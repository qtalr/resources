## Introduction

Finding data can be a challenging task, especially when you are looking for data that is relevant to your research project. Ideally you begin your data search with a research question in hand. This will allow you to vet sources as you encounter them. In other cases, however, you may begin to peruse available resources and brainstorm potential research questions that a given resource may support.

In either case, it is helpful to have a place to start. Below I've included various sources and data/datasets that will help you kickstart your exploration. There is a vast world of data available on the web and this list is by no means exhaustive.
