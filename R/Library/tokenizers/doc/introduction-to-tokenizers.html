<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="package-overview">Package overview</h2>
<p>In natural language processing, tokenization is the process of breaking human-readable text into machine readable components. The most obvious way to tokenize a text is to split the text into words. But there are many other ways to tokenize a text, the most useful of which are provided by this package.</p>
<p>The tokenizers in this package have a consistent interface. They all take either a character vector of any length, or a list where each element is a character vector of length one. The idea is that each element comprises a text. Then each function returns a list with the same length as the input vector, where each element in the list contains the tokens generated by the function. If the input character vector or list is named, then the names are preserved, so that the names can serve as identifiers.</p>
<p>Using the following sample text, the rest of this vignette demonstrates the different kinds of tokenizers in this package.</p>

<p>A skip n-gram is like an n-gram in that it takes the <code>n</code> and <code>n_min</code> parameters. But rather than returning contiguous sequences of words, it will also return sequences of n-grams skipping words with gaps between <code>0</code> and the value of <code>k</code>. This function generates all such sequences, again omitting stopwords if desired. Note that the number of tokens returned can be very large.</p>
