## Steps to get started

To get started with the textbook and the resources available in the kit, follow these steps:

1. Choose and set up your preferred R environment. See the [Setting up an R environment](guides/guide-01/) guide for a description of the possible setups and instructions on how to set up your R environment.
2. Install the key packages used in the textbook. These include {tidyverse}, {tinytex}, {swirl}, and {qtkit}. See the [Installing and managing R packages](guides/guide-02/) guide for instructions on how to install these (and other) packages.
3. Load the interactive R programming lessons in your R environment. See the [Working with the interactive R programming lessons](guides/guide-03/) guide for instructions on how to do this.

With these steps completed, you will be ready to start working with the textbook and the resources available in the kit. Refer back to this site for additional information and resources as needed.
