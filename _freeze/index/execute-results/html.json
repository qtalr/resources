This site provides description and access to supplementary resources for the textbook.\n---\n\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary resources available for the textbook include the following:\n\n| Resource | Description | Location |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| [Lessons](https://qtalr.github.io/lessons) | A series of interactive R programming lessons using {swirl} that accompany the textbook. | GitHub |\n| [Recipes](recipes) | A collection of coding demonstrations and examples that illustrate how to perform specific tasks in the text analysis workflow. | Resources Kit |\n| [Labs](https://github.com/stars/francojc/lists/labs) | A series of hands-on exercises that guide you through the process of conducting text analysis research. | GitHub |\n\n: Resources Kit for the textbook {#tbl-resources-kit tbl-colwidths=\"[20, 65, 15]\"}\n\nIn addition to these main resources, the Resources Kit also includes the following:\n\n| Resource | Description | Location |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| [Guides](guides) | A collection of guides that provide additional information and instructions on how to use the resources available in the kit. | Resources Kit |\n| [Instructors](instructors) | Information for instructors who are using the textbook in their courses. | Resources Kit |\n\n: Additional resources in the Resources Kit {#tbl-additional-resources tbl-colwidths=\"[20, 65, 15]\"}\n\n## Steps to get started\n\nTo get started with the textbook and the resources available in the kit, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose and set up your preferred R environment. See the [Setting up an R environment](guides/guide-01/) guide for a description of the possible setups and instructions on how to set up your R environment.\n2. Install the key packages used in the textbook. These include {tidyverse}, {tinytex}, {swirl}, and {qtkit}. See the [Installing and managing R packages](guides/guide-02/) guide for instructions on how to install these (and other) packages.\n3. Load the interactive R programming lessons in your R environment. See the [Working with the interactive R programming lessons](guides/guide-03/) guide for instructions on how to do this.\n\nWith these steps completed, you will be ready to start working with the textbook and the resources available in the kit. Refer back to this site for additional information and resources as needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
