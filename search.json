This template shows how instructors can easily create interactive web documents that students can use in self-guided learning.\nThe {webexercises} package provides a number of functions that you use in inline R code or through code chunk options to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given below. Render this file to HTML to see how it works.\nNOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser."

You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\nLonger MCQs (longmcq())\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use longmcq() to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It’s probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with echo=FALSE.\nWhat is a p-value?\n\n the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion\n\nWhat is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?\n\n 95% of the data fall within this range there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean"
