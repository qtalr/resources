    "text": "Concepts and strategies\n\nLiterate Programming\nFirst introduced by Donald Knuth (1984), the aim of Literate Programming is to be able to combine computer code and text prose in one document. This allows an analyst to run code, view the output of the code, view the code itself, and provide prose description all in one document. In this way, a literate programming document allows for presenting your analysis in a way that performs the computing steps desired and presents it in an easily readable format. Literate programming is now a key component of creating and sharing reproducible research (Gandrud 2015).\n\n\nQuarto\nQuarto is a specific implementation of the literate programming paradigm. In Figure 1 we see an example of Quarto in action. On the left we see the Quarto source code, which is a combination of text and code. On the right we see the output of the Quarto source code as an HTML document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quarto source (left) and output (right) example.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto documents generate various types of output: web documents (HTML), PDFs, Word documents, and many other types of output formats all based on the same source code. While the interleaving of code and prose to create a variety of output documents is one of the most attractive aspects of literate programming and Quarto, it is also possible to create documents with no code at all. It is a very versatile technology as you will come to appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dive deeper\nTo see Quarto in action, please check out the Quarto Gallery for a variety of examples of Quarto documents and their output.\n\n\n\nA Quarto source document is a plain-text file with the extension .qmd that can be opened in any plain text reader. We will be using the RStudio IDE (henceforth RStudio) to create, open, and edit, and generate output from .qmd files but any plain-text reader, such as TextEdit (MacOS) or Notepad (PC) can open these files.\nWith this in mind, let’s now move on to the anatomy of a Quarto document.\n\nAnatomy of a Quarto Document\nAt the most basic level a Quarto document contains two components:\n\na front-matter section and\na prose section.\n\nA third component, a code block, can be interleaved within the prose section to add code to the document. Let’s look at each of these in turn.\n\nFront-matter\nThe front matter of a Quarto document appears, well, at the front of the document (or the top, rather). Referring back to Figure Figure 1, we see the front matter at the top.\n---\ntitle: \"Introduction to Quarto\"\nauthor: \"Jerid Francom\"\nformat: html\n---\nWhen creating a Quarto document with RStudio the default attribute keys are title, author, and format. The front matter is fenced by three dashes ---.\nThe values for the first two keys are pretty straightforward and can be edited as needed. The value for the format attribute can also be edited to tell the .qmd file to generate other output types. Can you guess what value we might use to generate a PDF document? Yep, it’s just pdf. As we work Quarto you will learn more about how to use the RStudio interface to change some of these key-value pairs and add others!\n\n\nProse\nAnywhere below the front matter and not contained within a code block (see below) is open for prose. The prose section(s) have an added functionality in that they are Markdown aware. What does that mean, you say? Well, Markdown refers to a set of plain-text formatting conventions to produce formatted text in the output document. To quote Wikipedia:\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.\n\nWhat this enables us to do is to add simple text conventions to signal how the output should be formatted. Say we want to make some text bold. We just add ** around the text we want to appear bold.\n**bold text**\nWe can also do:\n\nitalics *italics*\nlinks [links](http://wfu.edu)\nstrikethrough ~~strikethrough~~\netc.\n\nFollow this link find more information on basic Markdown syntax.\n\n\nCode blocks\nCode blocks are where the R magic happens. Again, referring to Figure 1, we see that there is the following code block.\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\nA code block is bound by three backticks ```. After the first backticks the curly brackets {} allow us to tell Quarto which programming language to use to evaluate (i.e. run) in the code block. In most cases this will be R, hence the the opening curly bracket `{r}`. But there are other languages that can be used in Quarto, such as Python, SQL, and Bash.\nIn the previous example, R is used as a simple calculator adding 1 + 1. Here’s what this code block produces.\n\n1 + 1\n\n&gt; [1] 2\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: add\n1 + 1\n```\nWe have only mentioned selecting the coding language and labeling the code block, but code blocks have various other options that can be used to determine how the code block should be used. Some common code block options are:\n\nhiding the code: #| echo: false\n\n```{r}\n#| label: add\n#| echo: false\n1 + 1\n```\n\n\n&gt; [1] 2\n\n\n\nhiding the output #| include: false\n\n```{r}\n#| label: add\n#| include: false\n1 + 1\n```\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nCreate and render a Quarto document\nThe easiest and most efficient way to create a Quarto source file is to use the RStudio point-and-click interface. Just use the toolbar to create a new file and select “Quarto Document…”, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Creating a new Quarto document in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will provide you a dialogue box asking you to add a title and author to the document and also allows you to select the type of document format to output, as seen in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Dialogue box for creating a new Quarto document in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter a title and author and leave the format set to HTML.\nOn clicking ‘Create’ you will get a Quarto document, as in Figure 4, with some default/ boilerplate prose and code blocks. The prose and code blocks can be deleted, and we can start our own document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto source in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for now, let’s leave things as they are and see how to generate the output report from this document. Click “Render” in the RStudio toolbar. Before it will render, you will be asked to save the file and give it a name.\nOnce you have done that the .qmd file will render in the format you have specified and open in the ‘Viewer’ pane, as seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Quarto source and HTML output side-by-side in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dive deeper\nWatch Getting Started with Quarto for a guided tour of Quarto (Çetinkaya-Rundel 2023)."

    "text": "Concepts and strategies\nFor many of the style components that we use in Quarto, there is a part that is addressed in the front-matter section and a part that is addressed in the prose section and/ or code block sections.\nTo refresh our memory, the front-matter is fenced by three dashes (---) and is where we set the document attributes. The prose section is where we write the text of the document. The code block section is where we write the code that will be executed and is fenced by three backticks (```) and the name of the code interpreter {r} (R for us).\n\n\n\nListing 1: Basic Quarto document structure\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"My document title\"\nformat: pdf\n---\n\nThis is the prose section.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: example-code-block\n1 + 1\n```\n\n\n\n---\n1title: \"My document title\"\n2format: pdf\n---\n\n3This is the prose section.\n\n4```{r}\n#| label: example-code-block\n1 + 1\n```\n\n1\n\nThe title of the document\n\n2\n\nThe format of the document\n\n3\n\nThe prose section\n\n4\n\nThe code block section\n\n\nWith this in mind let’s look at each of these elements in turn.\n\nNumbered sections\nTo number sections in Quarto, we use the number_sections key with the value yes. This is set in the front-matter section, nested under the value for the document type to be rendered. For example, to number sections in a PDF document, we would set the number-sections key to true in the front-matter section as follows:\n---\n1title: \"My document title\"\n2format:\n3  pdf:\n4    number-sections: true\n---\n\n1\n\nThe title of the document\n\n2\n\nThe format of the document\n\n3\n\nThe type of document to be rendered, note the identation\n\n4\n\nThe key-value pair to number sections in the PDF document, again note the identation\n\n\nHeaders in the prose section are then numbered automatically. For example, the following markdown:\n# Section\n\n## Subsection\n\n### Subsubsection\n\n#### Subsubsubsection\n\n##### Subsubsubsubsection\nwould render as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also control the depth of the numbering by setting the number-depth key in the front-matter section. For example, to number sections and subsections, but not subsubsections, we would set the number-depth key to 2 as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"My document title\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    number-sections: true\n1    number-depth: 2\n---\n\n1\n\nThe key-value pair to control the depth of the numbering\n\n\nNow the first and second headers are numbered and formated but third and subsequent headers are only formatted.\nIf for some reason you want to turn off numbering for a specific header, you can add {.unnumbered} to the end of the header. For example, the following markdown:\n# Section {.unnumbered}\nThis is particularly useful in academic writing when we want to add a reference, materials, or other section that is not numbered at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Warning\nNote that if you have a header that is unnumbered, the next header will be numbered as if the unnumbered header did not exist. This can have unexpected results if you have children of an unnumbered header.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of contents\nFor longer documents including a table of contents can be a useful way to help readers navigate the document. To include a table of contents in Quarto, we use the toc key with the value true. Again, in the front-matter section, nested under the format value, as seen below:\n---\ntitle: \"My document title\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n1    toc: true\n---\n\n1\n\nThe key-value pair to include a table of contents in the PDF document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip\nFor PDF and Word document outputs, the table of contents will be automatically generated and placed at the beginning of the document. For HTML documents, the table of contents will be placed in the sidebar by default.\n\n\n\nIf if our headers are numbered, they will appeared numbered in the table of contents. If we unnnumbered a header, it will not appear with a section number. As with section numbering, we can also control the depth of the table of contents by setting the toc-depth key in the front-matter section. For example, to include sections and subsections, but not subsubsections, we would set the toc-depth key to 2 as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"My document title\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n1    toc-depth: 2\n---\n\n1\n\nThe key-value pair to control the depth of the table of contents\n\n\nAnd as with section numbering we can avoid listing a header in the table of contents by adding {.unlisted} to the end of the header.\n\n\nCross-referencing tables and figures\nAnother key element in academic writing are using cross-references to tables and figures. This allows us to refer to a table or figure by number without having to manually update the number if we add or remove a table or figure.\nIn this case, we will not need to add anything to the front-matter section. Instead, we will modify keys in the code block section of a code-generated table or figure.\nTo cross-reference a table or figure, we need to add a prefix to the label key’s value. The prefix, either tbl- or fig-, indicates whether the label is for a table or figure. Additionally, table or figure captions can be added with the tbl-cap or fig-cap keys, respectively.\nLet’s look at a basic figure that we can cross-reference. The following code block will generate a very simple scatterplot.\n```{r}\n1#| label: fig-scatterplot\n2#| fig-cap: \"A scatterplot\"\n\nplot(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)\n```\n\n3In @fig-scatterplot we see a scatterplot. ....\n\n1\n\nThe label for the figure. Includes fig- as a prefix.\n\n2\n\nThe caption for the figure.\n\n3\n\nThe in-line reference to the figure. Uses the @ symbol followed by the label value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(1:10, 1:10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A scatterplot\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1 we see a scatterplot. …\n\n\n\nFor tables generated by R, the process is very similar to that of figures. The only difference is that we use the tbl- prefix on the label value and the tbl-cap key instead of the fig-cap key for the caption.\nWe can also create tables using markdown syntax. In this case, the format is a little different. Consider Table Table 1, for example.\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| A        | B        | C        |\n| D        | E        | F        |\n\n: A simple table {#tbl-table-1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: A simple table\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1\nColumn 2\nColumn 3\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n\nD\nE\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-line citations and references list\nThe last element we will cover here is adding citations and a references list to a Quarto document. To add citations we need three things:\n\nA bibliography file\nA reference to the bibliography file in the front-matter section\nA citation in the prose section which is contained in the bibliography file\n\nThe bibliography file is a plain text file that contains the citations that we want to use in our document. The file requires the extension .bib and is formatted using the BibTeX format. BibTeX is a reference syntax that is commonly used in academia.\nLet’s take a look at a sample file, bibliography.bib, that contains a single reference.\n@Manual{R-dplyr,\n  title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},\n  author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller and Davis Vaughan},\n  year = {2023},\n  note = {R package version 1.1.4},\n  url = {https://dplyr.tidyverse.org},\n}\nIn this file, we can see that the reference is for a manual entry with @Manual. The type of entry will change what fields are relevant and/ or required. In this entry, we have the cite key R-dplyr, the title, the authors, the year, a note, and a URL. Other entries, and entry types will have different fields.\nYou can find BibTeX formatted references almost everywhere you can find scholarly work. For example, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus all provide BibTeX formatted references. Additionally, many journals provide BibTeX formatted references for the articles they publish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dive deeper\nManaging your references can be a challenge if you begin to amass a large number of them. There are a number of tools that can help you manage your references. For example, Zotero is a free, open-source reference manager that can help you organize your references and generate BibTeX formatted references.\nZotero also has a browser extension that allows you to easily add references to your Zotero library from your browser.\nFurthermore, Zotero can be connected to RStudio to facilitate the incorporation of BibTeX formatted references in a Quarto document. See the RStudio documentation for more information.\n\n\n\nIn the front-matter of our Quarto document, we need to add a reference to the bibliography file. This is done using the bibliography key. For example, if our bibliography file is called bibliography.bib and is located in the same directory as our Quarto document, we would add the following to the front-matter section:\n---\ntitle: \"My document title\"\nformat: pdf\n1bibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n\n1\n\nThe key-value pair to include a path to the file which contains the BibTeX formatted references.\n\n\nWith the bibliography file and the reference to the bibliography file in the front-matter section, we can now add citations to our document. To do this, we use the @ symbol followed by the citation key in the prose section. For example, to cite the R-dplyr reference from the bibliography.bib file, we would add @R-dplyr to the prose section as follows:\nThis is a citation to @R-dplyr.\nThe citation will appear as below in the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a citation to Wickham et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nAnd automatically, on rendering the document, a references list will be added to the end of the document. For this reason if you have citations in your document, it is a good idea to include a header section # References at the end of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip\nThere are a number of ways of having your inline citations appear. For example, in parentheses, with multiple citations, only with the year, adding a page number, etc.. For more information on how to format your citations, see the Quarto documentation."
