One might object that the NP headed by might is bad because of the multiple postmodifiers, but in fact there is no absolute constraint against stacking nominal postmodifiers, and good examples can be constructed with the same structure: marlinespikes, business end up, sprinkled with tabasco sauce, can be a powerful deterrent against pigeons. Even the commas are not absolutely required. The strength of preference for them depends on how heavy the modifiers are: cf. strength judicially applied increases the effectiveness of diplomacy, a cup of peanuts unshelled in the stock adds character. 3 In short, the structure (3) seems to be best characterized as grammatical, though it violates any number of parsing preferences and is completely absurd.

  abstract = {The rapid advancement in the theoretical understanding of statistical and machine learning methods for semisupervised learning has made it difficult for nonspecialists to keep up to date in the field. Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning.},

It can also be used for the analysis of courtroom discourse and interpret and translate the legal documents for their readability and comprehensibility. Moreover, the police cautions issued to the suspects can also be analyzed for their comprehensibility and the authorship attribution can be established for written or spoken texts.

Different sources, such as movies, music, games and books, can provide learners with exposure to the most common phrasal verbs in English. This study aims to investigate the degree to which music can play a role in exposing learners to phrasal verbs through analyzing their frequency in song lyrics from different genres (i.e., Pop, Rock, Hip-hop and Metal). For this purpose, a corpus of 400 song lyrics by different artists from these four genres was searched for all existing phrasal verbs. The resulting list of phrasal verbs was compared to Garnier and Schmitt's (2014) Phrasal Verb Pedagogical List in order to determine their value for learners. Further comparisons were subsequently drawn to determine which genre could be of greater use to language learning and instruction. The results revealed that song lyrics can potentially be a beneficial source for learning these constructions. Differences in the type and token frequency of phrasal verb among the four genres can also be used to determine the usefulness of each genre to students from various levels of proficiency.},

  abstract = {The growth of mobile phone users has lead to a dramatic increasing of SMS spam messages. In practice, fighting mobile phone spam is difficult by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS that has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. On the other hand, in academic settings, a major handicap is the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. Moreover, as SMS messages are fairly short, content-based spam filters may have their performance degraded. In this paper, we offer a new real, public and non-encoded SMS spam collection that is the largest one as far as we know. Moreover, we compare the performance achieved by several established machine learning methods. The results indicate that Support Vector Machine outperforms other evaluated classifiers and, hence, it can be used as a good baseline for further comparison.},

In this article, he reflects on the current and potential relationship between register and the field of computational linguistics. He applies his expertise in computational linguistics and machine learning to a variety of problems in natural language processing. These include stylistic variation, forensic linguistics, authorship attribution, and biomedical informatics. He is particularly interested in the linguistic structures used by speakers and writers, including linguistic choices that are influenced by social variables such as age, gender, and register, as well as linguistic choices that are unique or distinctive to the style of individual authors. Argamon has been a pioneer in computational linguistics and NLP research in his efforts to account for and explore register variation. His computational linguistic research on register draws inspiration from Systemic Functional Linguistics, Biber's multi-dimensional approach to register variation, as well as his own extensive experience accounting for variation within and across text types and authors. Argamon has applied computational methods to text classification and description across registers~-- including blogs, academic disciplines, and news writing~-- as well as the interaction between register and other social variables, such as age and gender. His cutting-edge research in these areas is certain to have a lasting impact on the future of computational linguistics and NLP.},

Much of this research has focused on the distributional properties of words, the units they consist of (morphemes, phonemes), and the syntactic structures they appear in (verb-categorization frames, syntactic constructions). In a series of studies we show that comprehenders are also sensitive to the frequencies of compositional four-word phrases (e.g. don't have to worry): more frequent phrases are processed faster. The effect is not reducible to the frequency of the individual words or substrings and is observed across the entire frequency range (for low, mid and high frequency phrases). Comprehenders seem to learn and store frequency information about multi-word phrases. These findings call for processing models that can capture and predict phrase-frequency effects and support accounts where linguistic knowledge consists of patterns of varying sizes and levels of abstraction. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Students learning a foreign language do not, of course, have a complete repertory of vocabulary and grammar; therefore, when faced with the need for a word that they do not know, they will try to resolve any ambiguity by deploying various communication strategies. These strategies include using approximations of meaning or circumlocutions, or simply switching to their mother tongue. Most studies in this field have been in the form of episodic reference. This study, however, focuses on the types of communication strategy that are most frequently used by certain EFL learners in a given situation, and on why those strategies are preferred. This study offers an analysis of a task-based corpus that was created specifically for this purpose.},

The present study supplements their work by making use of more flexible regression techniques that are better suited for dealing with collinearity and non-linearity, and by documenting the contributions of several variables that they did not take into account. In particular, we included measures of morphological connectivity, as well as a new frequency count, the frequency of a word in speech rather than in writing. The morphological measures emerged as strong predictors in visual lexical decision, but not in naming, providing evidence for the importance of morphological connectivity even for the recognition of morphologically simple words. Spoken frequency was predictive not only for naming but also for visual lexical decision. In addition, it co-determined subjective frequency estimates and norms for age of acquisition. Finally, we show that frequency predominantly reflects conceptual familiarity rather than familiarity with a word's form. ?? 2006.},

These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.},

  abstract = {For the sake of credit risk assessment, credit scoring has become a critical tool to discriminate ``bad'' applicants from ``good'' applicants for financial institutions. Accordingly, a wide range of supervised machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to credit scoring; however, integration of unsupervised learning with supervised learning in this field has drawn little consideration. In this work, we propose a combination strategy of integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning for credit risk assessment. The difference between our work and other previous work on unsupervised integration is that we apply unsupervised learning techniques at two different stages: the consensus stage and dataset clustering stage. Comparisons of model performance are performed based on three credit datasets in four groups: individual models, individual models\,+\,consensus model, clustering\,+\,individual models, clustering\,+\,individual models\,+\,consensus model. As a result, integration at either the consensus stage or dataset clustering stage is effective on improving the performance of credit scoring models. Moreover, the combination of the two stages achieves the best performance, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, which boost our confidence that this strategy can be extended to many other credit datasets from financial institutions.},

It provides a consistent workflow for using R that is simple, efficient, reliable, and reproducible. This second edition has been updated and expanded while retaining the concise and engaging nature of its predecessor, offering an accessible and fun introduction to the packages dplyr and ggplot2 for data manipulation and graphing. It expands the set of basic statistics considered in the first edition to include new examples of a simple regression, a one-way and a two-way ANOVA. Finally, it introduces a new chapter on the generalised linear model.

We analyze a commonly-observed process of historical language change: The loss of inflected forms in favour of `analytic' periphrastic constructions. These tendencies are observed in parallel translations of the Book of Genesis in Old English and Modern English. We show that there are significant differences in the frequency distributions of the two texts, and that parts of these differences are independent of total number of words, style of translation, orthography or contents. We argue that they derive instead from the trade-off between synthetic inflectional marking in Old English and analytic constructions in Modern English. By exploiting the earliest ideas of Zipf, we show that the syntheticity of the language in these texts can be captured mathematically, a property we tentatively call their grammatical fingerprint. Our findings suggest implications for both the specific historical process of inflection loss and more generally for the characterization of languages based on statistical properties.},

Nevertheless, the postulational method can further the study of language, because it forces us to state explicitly whatever we assume, to define our terms, and to decide what things may exist independently and what things are interdependent.2 Certain errors can be avoided or corrected by examining and formu-lating our (at present tacit) assumptions and defining our (often unde-fined) terms.3 Also, the postulational method saves discussion, because it limits our statements to a defined terminology; in particular, it cuts us off from psychological dispute.4 Discussion of the fundamentals of our science 1 For a clear exposition of this method, see J. W. Young, Lectures on the Fundamental Concepts of Algebra and Geometry, New York 1911. 1 Cf. A. P. Weiss's set of postulates for psychology, Psychological Review. 32. 83. 3 Examples are many. Bopp took for granted that the formative elements of Indo-European were once independent words; this is a needless and unwarranted assumption. The last descendant of his error is the assumption that IE compound words are historically derived from phrases (Jacobi, Compositum und Nebensatz, Bonn 1897; this even in Brug-mann, Grundrisz I)I, 1, pp. 37. 78; cf. TAPA 45. 73 ff.). The notion is gaining ground that some forms have less meaning than others and are therefore more subject to phonetic change (Horn, Sprachkiirper und Sprachfunktion, Palaestra 135, Berlin 1921); I, for one, can discover no workable definition of the terms 'meaning' and 'phonetic change' under which this notion can be upheld. The whole dispute, perhaps today as unstilled as fifty years ago, about the regularity of phonetic change, is at bottom a question of terminology. *Recall the difficulties and obscurities in the writings of Humboldt and Steinthal, and the psychological dispute of Paul, Wundt, Delbrueck. From our point of view, the last-named was wrong in denying the value of descriptive data, but right in saying that it is indifferent what system of psychology a linguist believes in (Grundfragen der Sprach-forschung, Strassburg 1901). The trouble over the nature of the sentence is largely non-linguistic; contrast the simplicity and usefulness of Meillet's definition (adopted below), 153},

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

Yet, as I will suggest, the study of the results and methods of modern typology has important lessons for us as the field of linguistics undergoes a paradigm shift. Typologists study a wide range of language types, but I will show that even when one does theoretical work on a single, well-studied standardized national language like English, one can (and should) benefit from an awareness of typological findings.

Some approaches exist that try to correct this instability. However, their benefits can, at present, be appreciated only qualitatively. A similarity measure between two classification trees is introduced that can measure their closeness. Its usefulness is illustrated with synthetic data on the impact of radioactivity deposit through the environment. In this context, a modified node level stabilizing technique, referred to as the NLS-REP method, is introduced and shown to be more stable than the classical CART method. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we analyse reading aloud and lexical decision reaction times and accuracy rates for 2,336 words to assess the influence of subjective frequency and age of acquisition on performance. Specifically, we compare newly presented word frequency measures with the existing frequency norms of Kucera and Francis (1967), HAL (Burgess \& Livesay, 1998), Brysbaert and New (2009), and Zeno, Ivens, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995). We show that the use of the Kucera and Francis word frequency measure accounts for much less variance than the other word frequencies, which leaves more variance to be "explained" by familiarity ratings and age-of-acquisition ratings. We argue that subjective frequency ratings are no longer needed if researchers have good objective word frequency counts. The effect of age of acquisition remains significant and has an effect size that is of practical relevance, although it is substantially smaller than that of the first phoneme in naming and the objective word frequency in lexical decision. Thus, our results suggest that models of word processing need to utilize these recently developed frequency estimates during training or setting baseline activation levels in the lexicon.},

There are few studies have examined data science programs within a particular discipline, such as Business (e.g. Chen et al.).

Therefore, this study examines data science programs offered by American universities. The study aims to depict the current state of data science education in the U.S. to explore what discipline DS programs covers at the graduate level. The current study conducted an exploratory content analysis of 30 DS programs in the United States from a variety of disciplines. The analysis was conducted on course titles and course descriptions level. The study results indicate that DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Management schools seem to take the lead and the initiative in lunching and hosting DS programs. In addition, all DS programs requires the basic knowledge of database design, representation, extraction and management. Furthermore, DS programs delivered information skills through their core courses. Moreover, the study results show that almost 40 percent of required courses in DS programs is involved information representations, retrieval and programming. Additionally, DS programs required courses also addressed communication visualization and mathematics skills.},

The explicit goal of the contribution is to argue that a specific collocation found in a corpus of Spanish spoken in Texas, agarrar+NP (e.g., agarrar ayuda), is a loan translation that is calqued on English get+np support verb constructions (e.g., get help). We base our argument on the frequency and the linguistic distribution of the nonconventional usage within and between corpora and on the factors that favor its use. Our findings show that the overall frequency of agarrar is the same in Spanish in Texas as it is in the benchmark monolingual corpus of Mexican Spanish but that it is used differently in the two varieties, a difference that has grammatical, as well as semantic, ramifications.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamentals of multidimensional dialogue act annotation, i.e. with what it means to annotate dialogues with information about the communicative acts that are performed with the utterances, taking various `dimensions' into account. Two ideas seem to be prevalent in the literature concerning the notion of dimension: (1) dimensions correspond to different types of information; and (2) a dimension is formed by a set of mutually exclusive tags. In DAMSL, for instance, the terms `dimension' and `layer' are used sometimes in the sense of (1) and sometimes in that of (2). We argue that being mutually exclusive is not a good criterion for a set of dialogue act types to constitute a dimension, even though the description of an object in a multidimensional space should never assign more than one value per dimension. We define a dimension of dialogue act annotation as an aspect of participating in a dialogue that can be addressed independently by means of dialogue acts. We show that DAMSL dimensions such as Info-request, Statement, and Answer do not qualify as proper dimensions, and that the communicative functions in these categories do not fall in any specific dimension, but should be considered as `general-purpose' in the sense that they can be used in any dimension. We argue that using the notion of dimension that we propose, a multidimensional taxonomy of dialogue acts emerges that optimally supports multidimensional dialogue act annotation.},

Using Biber's (Biber et~al., 1999; Biber et~al., 2004) structural and functional taxonomy, we compared the forms and functions of four-word bundles used by L1-English and L1-Chinese university students. Findings indicate that L2 students not only use substantially more bundle types and tokens than L1 writers, but the structural and functional patterns of bundles also differ. While L1 writers' bundles consist of mostly noun and preposition phrases, L2 students use significantly more verb phrase (clausal) bundles. Results also show that L2 student writers use significantly more stance bundles than L1 writers. In addition, most of the misused bundles in the L2 writers' essays pertain to grammatical mistakes, particularly with articles and prepositions. We conclude with some pedagogical implications for ESL composition.},

However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the \{{\textbackslash}em status quo\} for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.},

Based on 1,816~spelling errors, the analysis focuses on four mechanisms (transposition, insertion, omission, and substitution), and the influence of contextual and non-contextual (cognitive, inter- and intralinguistic, extralinguistic) factors is taken into account for each mechanism in question. Despite the multidimensional nature of the factors involved, the recurrence of certain errors makes it possible to distinguish clear trends in the acquisition of linguistic facts. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the obtained data allows cross-sectional studies of errors, which traces back the steps in the acquisition of various aspects of Russian spelling, from A1 to C1 level for the first time. Moreover, the qualitative analysis of errors provides valuable data for pedagogical materials.},

It requires computational tools and programming environments that handle big data and difficult computations, while supporting creative, high-quality analysis. The R language and related software play a major role in computing for data science. R is featured in most programs for training in the field. R packages provide tools for a wide range of purposes and users. The description of a new technique, particularly from research in statistics, is frequently accompanied by an R package, greatly increasing the usefulness of the description.             The history of R makes clear its connection to data science. R was consciously designed to replicate in open-source software the contents of the S software. S in turn was written by data analysis researchers at Bell Labs as part of the computing environment for research in data analysis and collaborations to apply that research, rather than as a separate project to create a programming language. The features of S and the design decisions made for it need to be understood in this broader context of supporting effective data analysis (which would now be called data science). These characteristics were all transferred to R and remain central to its effectiveness. Thus, R can be viewed as based historically on a domain-specific language for the domain of data science.},

(2010). Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA 2014). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that the integrative complexity of political rhetoric tends to drop during election season, but little research to date directly addresses if this drop in complexity serves to increase or decrease electoral success. The two present studies help fill this gap. Study 1 demonstrates that, during the Democratic Party primary debates in 2003--2004, the eventual winners of the party nomination showed a steeper drop in integrative complexity as the election season progressed than nonwinning candidates. Study 2 presents laboratory evidence from the most recent presidential campaign demonstrating that, while the complexity of Obama's rhetoric had little impact on college students' subsequent intentions to vote for him, the complexity of McCain's rhetoric was significantly positively correlated with their likelihood of voting for him. Taken together, this research is inconsistent with an unqualified simple is effective view of the complexity-success relationship. Rather, it is more consistent with a compensatory view: Effective use of complexity (or simplicity) may compensate for perceived weaknesses. Thus, appropriately timed shifts in complexity levels, and/or violations of negative expectations relevant to complexity, may be an effective means of winning elections. Surprisingly, mere simplicity as such seems largely ineffective.},

The study analyzes whether word frequency is the strongest predictor of early L2 word production independent of contextual diversity and distinctiveness and whether differences exist in the lexical properties of nouns and verbs that can help explain beginning-level L2 word production. The study uses machine learning algorithms to develop models that predict produced and unproduced words in L2 oral discourse. The results demonstrate that word frequency is the strongest classifier of whether a noun is produced or not produced in beginning L2 oral discourse, whereas contextual diversity is the strongest classifier of whether a verb is produced or not produced. Post hoc tests reveal that nouns are more concrete, meaningful, imageable, specific, and unambiguous than verbs, which indicates that lexical properties may explain differences in noun and verb production. Thus, whereas distributional properties of nouns may allow lexical acquisition on the basis of association through exposure alone (i.e., nouns may adhere to frequency effects), the abstractness and ambiguity found in verbs make them difficult to acquire based solely on repetition. Therefore, verb acquisition may follow a principle of likely need characterized by contextual diversity effects.},

One of the main advantages of corpora is that we know exactly the domain of texts from which the corpus data is derived, something that we cannot track from current large language models underlying applications like ChatGPT. We know the texts that make up large general corpora such as BNC2014 and BAWE, and can even extract full texts from these corpora if needed. Corpora also allow for more nuanced analysis of language patterns, including the statistics behind multi-word units and collocations, which can be difficult for GenAI to handle. However, it is important to note that GenAI has its own strengths in advancing our understanding of language-in-use that corpora, to date, have struggled with. We therefore argue that by combining corpus and GenAI approaches, language learners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how language works in different contexts than is currently possible using only a single approach.},

  title = {From Distributional to Semantic Similarity},
  author = {Curran, James Richard},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incorporated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval, since the alternative, application-based evaluation, can often be influenced by distributional as well as semantic similarity. I also perform a detailed analysis of the final results using WORDNET. Finally, I apply my similarity metric to the task of assigning words to WORDNET semantic categories. I demonstrate that this new approach outperforms existing methods and overcomes some of their weaknesses.},

Analysis was based on a phonetically transcribed corpus of 6,659 utterances of 6 normally developing infants obtained from one-hour weekly audio-recordings over a 4--6 month period. Intrasyllabic predictions were that front vowels would preferentially co-occur with front (alveolar) consonants, back vowels with back (velar) consonants, and central vowels with labial consonants, with the latter effect presumably resulting from mandibular oscillation alone. Intersyllabic predictions were for more variegation in tongue height for vowels than in front-back tongue movement, and for consonant manner changes to predominate over place changes (related primarily to mandibular oscillation). All 30 individual predictions from both hypotheses were confirmed, leading to a conception of the articulatory basis of babbling as ``Frame Dominance.''},

The performance-related frame/content approach is representative of the biological/functional perspective of phonetics in seeking explanations based on motor, perceptual and cognitive aspects of speech actions. From this perspective, intrasyllabic consonant-vowel (CV) co-occurrence patterns and intersyllabic sequence patterns are viewed as reflective of biomechanical constraints emerging from mandibular oscillation cycles. A labial-coronal sequence effect involved, in addition, the problem of interfacing the lexicon with the motor system, as well as the additional problem of initiation of movement complexes. Competence-based approaches to acquisition are within the generative phonological tradition; involving an initial assumption of innate, speech-specific mental structures. While various current phonological approaches to acquisition involve consideration of sequence effects and intrasyllabic patterns, they do not adequately establish the proposed mental entities in infants of this age, and are nonexplanatory in the sense of not considering the causes of the structures and constraints that they posit.},

Worryingly, as we show with real data, substantive inferences and model performance for unsupervised approaches are not generally robust to perturbations of common preprocessing steps. We introduce a statistical procedure and easy-to-use software---preText---allowing scholars to examine the sensitivity of their findings under alternate preprocessing regimes. For a range of datasets, we show that while some steps are mostly harmless, researchers should be cautious about others, since they transform the data in ways likely to lead the unwary down different " forking paths " of inference.},

This study adds to previous research on the development of spoken vocabulary by investigating lexical features of L2 Spanish learners over a 21-month period, using the LANGSNAP corpus. Multiple lexical richness indices used in previous studies were examined including lexical diversity, word frequency, word concreteness, and bigram strength of association. Linear mixed-effects models were run to examine changes over time. The results suggest that although some features of lexical richness (e.g., word frequency) see meaningful change over time, others (e.g., bigram T score) may not be indicative of L2 oral development.},

Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In 'The Future of Data Analysis', he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or 'data analysis'. Ten to twenty years ago, John Chambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested the catchy name "Data Science" for his envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon is the emergence of "Data Science" programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most recently the Univ. of Michigan, which on September 8, 2015 announced a \$100M "Data Science Initiative" that will hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; in general, though, the new initiatives steer away from close involvement with academic statistics departments. This paper reviews some ingredients of the current "Data Science moment", including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether Data Science is really different from Statistics. The now-contemplated field of Data Science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for 'scaling up' to 'big data'. This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in Data Science is not about mere 'scaling up', but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are 'learning from data', and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's Data Science Initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.},

While the most widely-used keyness measures are based on word frequency, an increasing number of research papers recently suggested dispersion-based measures as a better solution. These, however, are not new to Computational Literary Studies (CLS). In 2007, John Burrows introduced Zeta, a statistical measure that is mainly based on the degree of dispersion of a feature in a text corpus. In this paper, we also introduce Eta, a new measure of distinctiveness that is based on deviation of proportions suggested by Stefan Gries. By comparing Eta with Zeta, we demonstrate that both measures are able to identify relevant, interpretable distinctive words in a target corpus. Additionally, we make a first attempt to detect the key differences between these two measures by interpreting the top distinctive words.},

Understanding the circadian regulation of mood, which is vital for coping with day-to-day needs, requires large datasets and has classically utilised subjective reporting.                                         Methods:               In this study, we use a massive dataset of over 800 million Twitter messages collected over 4 years in the United Kingdom. We extract robust signals of the changes that happened during the course of the day in the collective expression of emotions and fatigue. We use methods of statistical analysis and Fourier analysis to identify periodic structures, extrema, change-points, and compare the stability of these events across seasons and weekends.                                         Results:               We reveal strong, but different, circadian patterns for positive and negative moods. The cycles of fatigue and anger appear remarkably stable across seasons and weekend/weekday boundaries. Positive mood and sadness interact more in response to these changing conditions. Anger and, to a lower extent, fatigue show a pattern that inversely mirrors the known circadian variation of plasma cortisol concentrations. Most quantities show a strong inflexion in the morning.                                         Conclusion:               Since circadian rhythm and sleep disorders have been reported across the whole spectrum of mood disorders, we suggest that analysis of social media could provide a valuable resource to the understanding of mental disorder.},

We sampled the contents of Twitter in the United Kingdom at hourly intervals for a period of four years, revealing a strong diurnal rhythm in most of the psychometric variables, and finding that two independent factors can explain 85\% of the variance across their 24-h profiles. The first has peak expression time starting at 5am/6am, it correlates with measures of analytical thinking, with the language of drive (e.g power, and achievement), and personal concerns. It is anticorrelated with the language of negative affect and social concerns. The second factor has peak expression time starting at 3am/ 4am, it correlates with the language of existential concerns, and anticorrelates with expression of positive emotions. Overall, we see strong evidence that our language changes dramatically between night and day, reflecting changes in our concerns and underlying cognitive and emotional processes. These shifts occur at times associated with major changes in neural activity and hormonal levels.},

Therefore, decision trees are suggested as an alternative method of analysis since they are not adversely affected by these factors.

Despite assertions about the power of social media to connect people across the world, we find that many of these neologisms are restricted to geographically compact areas. Even for words that become ubiquituous, their growth in popularity is often geographical, spreading from city to city. Thus, social media text offers a unique opportunity to study the diffusion of lexical change. In this paper, we show how an autoregressive model of word frequencies in social media can be used to induce a network of linguistic influence between American cities. By comparing the induced network with the geographical and demographic characteristics of each city, we can measure the factors that drive the spread of lexical innovation.},

Starting with the conceptual separation between feature selection, feature scaling, and distance measures, we have designed a series of controlled experiments in which we used the kind of feature scaling (various types of standardization and normalization) and the type of distance measures (notably Manhattan, Euclidean, and Cosine) as independent variables and the correct authorship attributions as the dependent variable indicative of the performance of each of the methods proposed. In this way, we are able to describe in some detail how each of these two variables interact with each other and how they influence the results. Thus we can show that feature vector normalization, that is, the transformation of the feature vectors to a uniform length of 1 (implicit in the cosine measure), is the decisive factor for the improvement of Delta proposed recently. We are also able to show that the information particularly relevant to the identification of the author of a text lies in the profile of deviation across the most frequent words rather than in the extent of the deviation or in the deviation of specific words only.},

However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.},

From these syllabi, we extracted data that allowed us to rank canonical sources and discuss the variety of software used in teaching.

For instance, scholars can use our technique to introduce their graduate students to the field of systematic reviews while improving the quality of their syllabi.},

Particular attention is paid to the comparison of collocability across different corpora representing different genres, registers, or modalities. Several issues involved in the interpretation of collocational patterns in the production of first language and second language users are also considered. Reflecting on the current practices in the field, further directions for collocation research are proposed.},

We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts---e.g., the women's movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States---and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

  abstract = {As researchers and practitioners are becoming more aware of the importance of multi-word items in English, there is little doubt that phrasal verbs deserve teaching attention in the classroom. However, there are thousands of phrasal verbs in English, and so the question for practitioners is which phrasal verbs to focus attention upon. Phrasal verb dictionaries typically try to be comprehensive, and this results in a very large number of phrasal verbs being listed, which does not help practitioners in selecting the most important ones to teach or test. There are phrasal verb lists available (Gardner and Davies, 2007; Liu, 2011), but these have a serious pedagogical shortcoming in that they do not account for polysemy. Research indicates that phrasal verbs are highly polysemous, having on average 5.6 meaning senses, although many of these are infrequent and peripheral. Thus practitioners also need guidance about which meaning senses are the most useful to address in instruction or tests. In response to this need, the PHrasal VErb Pedagogical List (PHaVE List) was developed. It lists the 150 most frequent phrasal verbs, and provides information on their key meaning senses, which cover 75\%+ of the occurrences in the Corpus of Contemporary American English. The PHaVE List gives the percentage of occurrence for each of these key meaning senses, along with definitions and example sentences written to be accessible for second language learners, in the style of the General Service List (West, 1953). A users? manual is also provided, indicating how to use the list appropriately.},

Possible reasons for this are suggested and arguments are presented for why (and how) corpus linguists should look more into the possibilities of complementing their corpus studies with experimental data. {\copyright} Walter de Gruyter.},

Results of a survey of phoneme frequency data within 34 languages suggest a parallel between cross-linguistic and intralanguage frequency. The distribution of phonemic length contrasts is also examined both across and within languages. Various explanations for the phoneme frequency patterns are introduced. These include accounts appealing directly to the phonetic notions of articulatory ease and/or perceptual distinctness (Dispersion Theory, Dispersion and Focalization Theory, and Quantal Theory) as well as theories that encode these physiological pressures indirectly via phonological features (Feature Enhancement Theory and Feature Economy Theory). The chapter concludes with an examination of the relationship between frequency and phonetic naturalness in shaping frequency biases diachronically.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

Using the example of SLA/FLA research, we first, briefly, discuss a highly influential model, Granger's (1996) Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), and the extent to which much current research fails to exploit this model to its full potential. Then, we outline a few methodological suggestions that, if followed, can elevate corpus-based analysis in SLA/FLA to a new level of precision and predictive accuracy. Specifically, we propose that, and exemplify how, the inclusion of statistical interactions in regressions on corpus data can highlight important differences between native speakers (NS) and learners/non-native speakers (NNS) with different native linguistic (L1) backgrounds. Secondly, we develop a two-step regression procedure that answers one of the most important questions in SLA/FLA research -- `What would a native speaker do?' -- and, thus, allows us to study systematic deviations between NS and NNS at an unprecedented degree of granularity. Both methods are explained and exemplified in detail on the basis of over 5,000 uses of may and can produced by NSs of English and French and Chinese learners of English.},

  abstract = {Much statistical analysis of psycholinguistic data is now being done with so-called mixed-effects regression models. This development was spearheaded by a few highly influential introductory articles that (i) showed how these regression models are superior to what was the previous gold standard and, perhaps even more importantly, (ii) showed how these models are used practically. Corpus linguistics can benefit from mixed-effects/multi-level models for the same reason that psycholinguistics can - because, for example, speaker-specific and lexically specific idiosyncrasies can be accounted for elegantly; but, in fact, corpus linguistics needs them even more because (i) corpus-linguistic data are observational and, thus, usually unbalanced and messy/noisy, and (ii) most widely used corpora come with a hierarchical structure that corpus linguists routinely fail to consider. Unlike nearly all overviews of mixed-effects/multi-level modelling, this paper is specifically written for corpus linguists to get more of them to start using these techniques more. After a short methodological history, I provide a nontechnical introduction to mixed-effects models and then discuss in detail one example - particle placement in English - to show how mixed-effects/multilevel modelling results can be obtained and how they are far superior to those of traditional regression modelling. {\copyright} Edinburgh University Press.},

This book is extremely hands-on and leads the reader through dozens of small applications as well as larger case studies. Along with an array of exercise boxes and separate answer keys, the text features a didactic sequential approach in case studies by way of subsections that zoom in to every programming problem. The companion website to the book contains all relevant R code (amounting to approximately 7,000 lines of heavily commented code), most of the data sets as well as pointers to others, and a dedicated Google newsgroup. This new edition is ideal for both researchers in corpus linguistics and instructors who want to promote hands-on approaches to data in corpus linguistics courses.},

Four small case studies -- three more programmatic and one more applied -- are offered to exemplify the logic and method. The first case study shows how parametric confidence intervals or confidence intervals from word-based bootstrapping can be inappropriate; the second case study exemplifies the computation of frequency-cum-dispersion intervals; the third does the same for collocational/collostructional data (the ditransitive); and the last case study exemplifies the use of these methods in a diachronic statutory-interpretation context.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods---they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature.

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

The dataset is provided in two format. The zip file contains many single .csv files, with each file for a single professor's webpage. The RateMyProfessor\_Sample data.csv is the combined version with many professors' information in a single csv file. We have crawled almost one million professors' information. The total dataset is over 5. The dataset crawled and extracted from RMP has 18 variables. This part briefly describes each variable that needs to be analyzed.  Professor name: name of the professor who is rated  School name: university where the professor is currently teaching  Department name: currently working there  Local name: university's locally known as  State name: state which the university is located in  Year since first review: the professor's teaching age, from the first student evaluation to the time when we did the analysis in year 2019.  Star rating: the star rating of the professor's overall quality, the point 3.5-5.0 is good, 2.5-3.4 is average and 1.0-2.4 is poor according to RMP's official standard. This star rating is the average score given to professors by all student comments;  Take again: percentage of students who want to choose this course again;  Difficulty index: The difficulty level of a course. Point 1 is easiest, and point 5 is hardest. The difficulty index is the average score given to professors by all students;  Tags: the tag students chose to describe a professor;  Post date: the date when the student posted an evaluation of a course;  Student star: each student gives a star rating to a professor;  Student-rated difficulty: every student gives difficulty index to a professor;  Attendance: whether a course is mandatory or not;  For credit: whether students chose a course for credit (yes or no);  Would take again: whether students would like to choose a course again (yes or no)  Grade: student's final score of a course, such as A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, WD, INC, Not, Audit/No. ``WD'' is Drop/Withdrawal. ``INC'' means Incomplete. ``Not'' is Not sure yet, and ``Audit/No'' is Audit/No Grade.  Comment: comments that students gave for professors.},

One type of bias, known as ``p-hacking,'' occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

Emerging ethical approaches have attempted to filter pretraining material, but such approaches have been ad hoc and failed to take into account context. We offer an approach to filtering grounded in law, which has directly addressed the tradeoffs in filtering material. First, we gather and make available the Pile of Law, a 256GB (and growing) dataset of open-source English-language legal and administrative data, covering court opinions, contracts, administrative rules, and legislative records. Pretraining on the Pile of Law may potentially help with legal tasks that have the promise to improve access to justice. Second, we distill the legal norms that governments have developed to constrain the inclusion of toxic or private content into actionable lessons for researchers and discuss how our dataset reflects these norms. Third, we show how the Pile of Law offers researchers the opportunity to learn such filtering rules directly from the data, providing an exciting new research direction in model-based processing.},

  abstract = {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data analysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data analysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data analysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis that is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal mechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each other. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and characterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the elements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the fundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis. This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data analyses.},

This paper presents the R extension package textcat for n-gram based text categorization which implements both the Cavnar and Trenkle approach as well as a reduced n-gram approach designed to remove redundancies of the original approach.

Cross-validation results are reported for each method, and each method is further employed in classifying the disputed papers and the few papers that are generally understood to be coauthored. These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ``raw'' feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ``pre-processed'' feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.},

  abstract = {Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature is written with students and scholars of literature in mind but will be applicable to other humanists and social scientists wishing to extend their methodological tool kit to include quantitative and computational approaches to the study of text. Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale ``microanalysis'' of single texts to large scale ``macroanalysis'' of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book's focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.},

This can be treated as a form of pattern evidence based on writing style, but the subjective analysis of writing style may have all the well-known problems of other forms of subjective pattern evidence. In this paper, we demonstrate a computer program to address these issues. This program analyzes a pair of documents (a known document and a questioned document) to determine if they were written by the same author. More importantly, this paper also validates the accuracy of this program through a large-scale series of controlled experiments involving English language blogs. Across more than 32,000 different document pairs, the system achieved a measured accuracy of 77\%. This paper concludes that this system not only addresses a key problem in forensic linguistics, but also provides the repeatability, reproducibility, and measured accuracy levels that are key to the advancement of forensic science.},

  abstract = {The familiar mathematical topics of introductory statistics --- means, proportions, t-tests, normal and t distributions, chi-squared, etc. --- are a product of the first half of the 20th century. Naturally, they reflect the statistical conditions of that era: scarce, e.g. n {$<$} 10, data originating in benchtop or agricultural experiments; algorithms communicated via algebraic formulas. Today, applied statistics relates to a different environment: software is the means of algorithmic communication, observational and " unplanned " data are interpreted for causal relationships, and data are large both in n and the number of variables. This change in situation calls for a thorough rethinking of the topics in and approach to statistics education. (Cobb 2015) In this paper, I present a set of ten organizing blocks for intro stats that, I claim, are better suited to today's environment. 1. Data tables 2. Data graphics 3. Model functions 4. Model training 5. Effect size and covariates 6. Displays of distributions 7. Bootstrap replication 8. Prediction error 9. Comparing models 10. Generalization and causality The extent of each theme, and the division of the whole into ten blocks, has been made with an eye toward covering each in roughly one week of a standard course. Keeping in mind that one of the drivers of change in statistics has been the transition from algebra to software as the mode of describing algorithms, computing should be integrated thoroughly across blocks. I'll illustrate the sorts of algorithms that support the themes using two new packages for R: ggformula and mosaicModel. These packages integrate data-science software such as the tidyverse (Wickham and Grolemund 2016) with the pedagogical approach of the mosaic package (Pruim, Kaplan, and Horton 2017). The discussion and computer commands in this paper are oriented toward instructors. An implementation of the blocks for students should take another form, one with much more basic and expository narrative and interactive scaffolding for computer commands.},

There has never been a better time to embrace transparent research practices. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research. Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal -- each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.},

However, the multitude of individual solutions combined with domain-inherent obstacles in data sharing have so far hampered comparability, reusability and reproducibility of data and research results. In this article, we present work in creating a digital infrastructure for L1 and L2 learner corpora and populating it with data collected in the past. We embed our infrastructure efforts in the broader field of infrastructures for scientific research, drawing from technical solutions and frameworks from research data management, among which the FAIR guiding principles for data stewardship. We share our experiences from integrating some L1 and L2 learner corpora from concluded projects into the infrastructure while trying to ensure compliance with the FAIR principles and the standards we established for reproducibility, discussing how far research data that has been collected in the past can be made comparable, reusable and reproducible. Our results show that some basic needs for providing comparable and reusable data are covered by existing general infrastructure solutions and can be exploited for domain-specific infrastructures such as the one presented in this article. Other aspects need genuinely domain-driven approaches. The solutions found for the corpora in the presented infrastructure can only be a preliminary attempt, and further community involvement would be needed to provide templates and models acknowledged and promoted by the community. Furthermore, forward-looking data management would be needed starting from the beginning of new corpus creation projects to ensure that all requirements for FAIR data can be met.},

Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods.

Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium.},

In order to build language-independent semantic representations of these documents, we train neural distributional models on monolingual corpora and learn the optimal linear transformation of vectors from one language to another. The resulting vectors are then used to produce 'semantic fingerprints' of documents, serving as input to a clustering algorithm. The presented method is compared to several baselines including 'orthographic translation' with Levenshtein edit distance and outperforms them by a large margin. We also show that language-independent 'semantic fingerprints' are superior to multi-lingual clustering algorithms proposed in the previous work, at the same time requiring less linguistic resources.},

The marginality and powerlessness of women is reflected in both the ways women are expected to speak, and the ways in which women are spoken of. In appropriate women's speech, strong expression of feeling is avoided, expression of uncertainty is favored, and means of expression in regard to subject-matter deemed 'trivial' to the 'real' world are elaborated. Speech about women implies an object, whose sexual nature requires euphemism, and whose social roles are derivative and dependent in relation to men. The personal identity of women thus is linguistically submerged; the language works against treatment of women, as serious persons with individual views.},

The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word--word and passage--word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

The results display a marked change: In 2009, a clear majority of the articles exhibit a preference for linguistic description over statistical reporting; in 2019, the exact opposite is true. The number of different statistical techniques employed has also gone up. While the increased statistical focus may reflect increased methodological sophistication, our results show that it has come at a cost: A diminished focus on linguistic description, evident, for example, through fewer text excerpts and linguistic examples, appear to be symptomatic of increasing distance from the language that is the object of study. We discuss these shifts and suggest some ways of employing sophisticated statistical techniques without sacrificing a focus on language.},

The study applies features of the syntactic complexity of sentences within legal text translations that translated texts are less complicated than their original counterparts. It provides an example of how easy plain English translation in legal communication might result in understandable target writings. The findings of the legal translation of the people of three regions reveal striking patterns in terms of syntactic complexity and legal communication in plain English, which are consistent with previous research. Complex nominal and hypotactic structures result in a high number of propositions per sentence, placing a high demand on the cognitive processing abilities of those who read and understand the text. The statistics show considerable differences among the three locations and various forms of company law corpora. The study is the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the accessibility of legal jargon compared to other forms of English, emphasizing the efficacy of plain-language initiatives in legal translations.}

The research is based on two comparable corpora, the English monolingual part of COCE (Corpus of Chinese-English) and the native English corpus of FLOB (Freiburg-LOB Corpus of British English). Using the 13 syntactic complexity measures falling into five subconstructs (i.e. length of production unit, amount of subordination, amount of coordination, phrasal complexity and overall sentence complexity), our results show that translation as a whole is less complex compared to non-translation, reflected most prominently in the amount of subordination and overall sentence complexity. Further pairwise comparison of the four subgenres of the corpora shows mixed results. Specifically, the translated news is homogenous to native news as evidenced by the complexity measures; the translated genres of general prose and academic writing are less complex compared to their native counterparts while translated fiction is more complex than non-translated fiction. It was found that mean sentence length always produced a significant effect on syntactic complexity, with higher syntactic complexity for longer sentence lengths in both corpora. ANOVA test shows a highly significant main effect of translation status, with higher syntactic complexity in the non-translated texts (FLOB) than the translated texts (COCE), which provides support for the simplification hypothesis in translation. It is also found that, apart from translation status, genre is an important variable in affecting the complexity level of translated texts. Our study offers new insights into the investigation of simplification hypothesis from the perspective of translation from English into Chinese.},

The aim was to obtain a large corpus of NP data which would allow different types of analysis of the children's productions to be carried out. Intra-individual variability in early NP types was analyzed and measured, and an elicitation task for adjectives was used. Results show that the acquisition of NP and gender agreement is a complex process which advances as the children gradually integrate different pieces of evidence : phonological, distributional and functional. The reduction of variability as the grammatical process advances is a key feature for its explanation.},

  abstract = {Open research practices are relevant to all stages of research, from conceptualization through dissemination. Here, we discuss key facets of open research, highlighting its rationales, infrastructures, behaviors, and challenges. Part I conceptualizes open research and its rationales. Part II identifies challenges such as the speed and cost of open research, the usability of open data and materials, the difficulties of conducting replication research, and the economics and sustainability of open access and open research generally. In discussing these challenges, we have sought to provide examples of good practice, describe and evaluate emerging innovations, and envision change. Part III considers ongoing coevolutions of culture, infrastructure, and behaviors and acknowledges the limitations of our review and of open research practices. We argue that open research is indeed a large part of our future, and most---if not all---challenges are surmountable, but doing so requires significant changes for many aspects of the research process.},

We developed a dataset of 6850 SMS-like sentences that can be used to classify input using a scheme of 9 stressor categories derived from: stress management literature, live conversations from a prototype chatbot system, crowdsourcing, and targeted web scraping from an online repository. In addition to releasing this dataset, we show results that are promising for classification purposes. Our contributions include: (i) a categorization of daily stressors, (ii) a dataset of SMS-like sentences, (iii) an analysis of this dataset that demonstrates its potential efficacy, and (iv) a demonstration of its utility for implementation via a simulation of model response times.},

  abstract = {Lexical diversity encompasses a wide variety of measures, all of which seek to quantify the range of vocabulary deployed in a given text. Researchers use these measures of lexical diversity in many fields, including language acquisition, stylistics, neuropathology, and linguistic forensics. Unfortunately, text length confounds all the measures, leading to questions of the conclusions of some studies. Many alternative measures have been introduced but all have failed to overcome the problem of text length correlation. We introduce and test a new measure of lexical diversity: the measure of textual, lexical diversity (MTLD). We test MTLD and 13 of the best known traditional measures of lexical diversity against the largest corpus yet established for such a test: 23 genres of spoken and written texts, comprising 414,000 words. The results of these tests supply evidence that none of the traditional measures avoid correlation with text length. MTLD, however, does not correlate with text length over the ranges tested suggesting that MTLD is the first reliable measure of lexical diversity. The significance of such a measure is that researchers and educators will be able to assess the lexical diversity of both spoken and written texts without concern for the differing text lengths. We also test all the traditional measures against a further corpus of NS and NNS. In these tests, both MTLD and some of the traditional measures predicted differences in the results. We conclude that MTLD is the only sophisticated measure that avoids correlation with text length but that using other sophisticate measures, in conjunction with MTLD, may be the best approach to analysing texts.},

The automated tool, Coh-Metrix, is used to examine the degree to which high- and low-proficiency essays can be predicted by linguistic indices of cohesion (i.e., coreference and connectives), syntactic complexity (e.g., number of words before the main verb, sentence structure overlap), the diversity of words used by the writer, and characteristics of words (e.g., frequency, concreteness, imagability). The three most predictive indices of essay quality in this study were syntactic complexity (as measured by number of words before the main verb), lexical diversity (as measured by the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity), and word frequency (as measured by Celex, logarithm for all words). Using 26 validated indices of cohesion from Coh-Metrix, none showed differences between high- and low-proficiency essays and no indices of cohesion correlated with essay ratings. These results indicate that the textual features that characterize good student writing are not aligned with those features that facilitate reading comprehension. Rather, essays judged to be of higher quality were more likely to contain linguistic features associated with text difficulty and sophisticated language.},

LOCO is an 88-million-token corpus composed of topic-matched conspiracy (N\,=\,23,937) and mainstream (N\,=\,72,806) documents harvested from 150 websites. Mimicking internet user behavior, documents were identified using Google by crossing a set of seed phrases with a set of websites. LOCO is hierarchically structured, meaning that each document is cross-nested within websites (N\,=\,150) and topics (N\,=\,600, on three different resolutions). A rich set of linguistic features (N\,=\,287) and metadata includes upload date, measures of social media engagement, measures of website popularity, size, and traffic, as well as political bias and factual reporting annotations. We explored LOCO's features from different perspectives showing that documents track important societal events through time (e.g., Princess Diana's death, Sandy Hook school shooting, coronavirus outbreaks), while patterns of lexical features (e.g., deception, power, dominance) overlap with those extracted from online social media communities dedicated to conspiracy theories. By computing within-subcorpus cosine similarity, we derived a subset of the most representative conspiracy documents (N\,=\,4,227), which, compared to other conspiracy documents, display prototypical and exaggerated conspiratorial language and are more frequently shared on Facebook. We also show that conspiracy website users navigate to websites via more direct means than mainstream users, suggesting confirmation bias.

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna-tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of " Canada " and " Air " cannot be easily combined to obtain " Air Canada " . Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

By then, it was becoming clear in several disciplines that the solution to some of their problems depended crucially on solving problems traditionally allocated to other disciplines.

Winner of a 2012 PROSE Award in Computing and Information Sciences from the Association of American Publishers, this book presents a comprehensive how-to reference that shows the user how to conduct text mining and statistically analyze results. In addition to providing an in-depth examination of core text mining and link detection tools, methods and operations, the book examines advanced preprocessing techniques, knowledge representation considerations, and visualization approaches. Finally, the book explores current real-world, mission-critical applications of text mining and link detection using real world example tutorials in such varied fields as corporate, finance, business intelligence, genomics research, and counterterrorism activities. The world contains an unimaginably vast amount of digital information which is getting ever vaster ever more rapidly. This makes it possible to do many things that previously could not be done: spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on. Managed well, the textual data can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide fresh insights into science and hold governments to account. As the Internet expands and our natural capacity to process the unstructured text that it contains diminishes, the value of text mining for information retrieval and search will increase dramatically.

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

The paper illustrates its use in the exploration of a corpus of academic English. It first offers the intuitive explanation of the underlying mechanism of topic modelling and describes the procedure for building a model, including the decisions involved in the model-building process. The paper then explores the model. A topic in topic models is characterised by a set of co-occurring words, and we will demonstrate that such topics bring us rich insights into the nature of a corpus. As exemplary tasks, this paper identifies the prominent topics in different parts of papers, investigates the chronological change of a journal, and reveals different types of papers in the journal. The paper further compares topic modelling to two more traditional techniques in corpus linguistics, semantic annotation and keywords analysis, and highlights the strengths of topic modelling. We believe that topic modelling is particularly useful in the initial exploration of a corpus.},

It has grown to be something like a booming industry alongside more established 'communication enterprises', such as health communication, risk communication, and science communication. This article situates the theory of climate change communication within theoretical developments in the field of science communication. It discusses the importance and difficulties inherent in talking about climate change to different types of publics using various types of communication tools and strategies. It engages with the difficult issue of the relationship between climate change communication and behavior change, and it focuses, in particular, on the role of language (metaphors, words, strategies, frames, and narratives) in conveying climate change issues to stakeholders. In the process, it attempts to provide an overview of emerging theories of climate change communication, theories that recently have begun to proliferate quite dramatically. In some cases, we can, therefore only provide signposts to the most relevant research that is being carried out with regard to climate change communication without being able to engage with all its aspects. We end with an assessment of how communication could be improved in light of the theories and practices discussed in this article .}

  abstract = {Languages and genes are both transmitted from generation to generation, with opportunity for differential reproduction and survivorship of forms. Here we apply a rigorous inference framework, drawn from population genetics, to distinguish between two broad mechanisms of language change: drift and selection. Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and it may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic forms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic differences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the population. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to the 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and syntactic variation in verbal negation. We show that we can reject stochastic drift in favor of a selective force driving some of these language changes, but not others. The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift provides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change than others. Our results suggest an important role for stochasticity in language change, and they provide a null model against which selective theories of language evolution must be compared.},

Specifically, it addresses two issues: the relation between word frequency in corpora and native speakers' self-reported frequency of word use, and the relation between word frequency and word dispersion in corpora. Seventeen native speakers of English were asked how frequently they think they use 240 target words. The dispersion rates of the target words were calculated according to their sub-frequencies observed in the British National Corpus and the Corpus of Contemporary American English. The results indicate that corpus word frequency is closely related to native speakers' self-reported frequency of word use up to the 7000-word level, and that word frequency is related to word dispersion, with high dispersion rates observed up to the 6000-word level. These results have important implications for vocabulary selection for EFL textbooks and goal setting for vocabulary teaching. They suggest that native speakers make reasonable judgments on word usefulness up to the 7000-word level in terms of frequency. Furthermore, it would seem sensible to set the upper limit of vocabulary teaching at the 6000-word level in terms of frequency and dispersion.},

However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80\% of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

Zellig Harris had advocated a close alliance between grammatical and information-theoretic principles in the analysis of natural language, and early formal-language theory provided another strong link between information theory and linguistics. Nevertheless, in most research on language and computation, grammatical and information-theoretic approaches had moved far apart. Today, after many years on the defensive, the information-theoretic approach has gained new strength and achieved practical successes in speech recognition, information retrieval, and, increasingly, in language analysis and machine translation. The exponential increase in the speed and storage capacity of computers is the proximate cause of these engineering successes, allowing the automatic estimation of the parameters of probabilistic models of language by counting occurrences of linguistic events in very large bodies of text and speech. However, I will argue that information-theoretic and computational ideas are also playing an increasing role in the scientific understanding of language, and will help bring together formal-linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives.},

The book covers all necessary knowledge for using R, from its installation in your computer to the organization and development of scripts. For every chapter, the book presents practical and replicable examples of R code, providing context and facilitating the learning process. Based on the material, the reader will learn how to download financial data from local files or the Internet, represent and process it using native objects in R, and create tables and figures to report the results in a technical document. The book is organized based on the author's practical experience in scientific research and includes instructions for using the best R packages for each purpose, such as xtable and texreg for reporting tables, dplyr in data processing, and ggplot2 in creating figures. After showing the capabilities of R in processing financial data, the last chapter presents three complete and reproducible examples of research in Finance. This book is recommended for researchers and students interested in learning how to use R. No prior knowledge of programming or finance is required to take advantage of this book. After finishing, the reader will have enough knowledge to develop their own scripts autonomously, producing academic documents or data analysis for public and private institutions.},

Evidence for a text's topic and genre comes, in part, from its lexical and syntactic features---features used in both Automatic Topic Classification and Automatic Genre Classification (AGC). Because an ideal AGC system should be stable in the face of changes in topic distribution, we assess five previously published AGC methods with respect to both performance on the same topic--genre distribution on which they were trained and stability of that performance across changes in topic--genre distribution. Our experiments lead us to conclude that (1) stability in the face of changing topical distributions should be added to the evaluation critera for new approaches to AGC, and (2) Part-of-Speech features should be considered individually when developing a high-performing, stable AGC system for a particular, possibly changing corpus.},

A previous article about our work in this area appeared in Nature. The General Index was also the subject of a more recent article in Nature.  Declaration of Support for the General Index  ``Public Resource, a registered nonprofit organization based in California, has created a General Index to scientific journals. The General Index consists of a listing of n-grams, from unigrams to five-grams, extracted from 107 million journal articles.   The General Index is non-consumptive, in that the underlying articles are not released, and it is transformative in that the release consists of the extraction of facts that are derived from that underlying corpus.  The General Index is available for free download with no restrictions on use. This is an initial release, and the hope is to improve the quality of text extraction, broaden the scope of the underlying corpus, provide more sophisticated metrics associated with terms, and other enhancements.   Access to the full corpus of scholarly journals is an essential facility to the practice of science in our modern world. The General Index is an invaluable utility for researchers who wish to search for articles about plants, chemicals, genes, proteins, materials, geographical locations, and other entities of interest. The General Index allows scholars and students all over the world to perform specialized and customized searches within the scope of their disciplines and research over the full corpus.   Access to knowledge is a human right and the increase and diffusion of knowledge depends on our ability to stand on the shoulders of giants. We applaud the release of the General Index and look forward to the progress of this worthy endeavor.''   Signatories to the Declaration of Support  Dr. Vinton G.

Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.},

Seven- and 10-year-old boys and girls from bilingual classrooms were each paired with a mutually selected friend, and their speech was collected in two contexts: while the children waited for an expected science experiment and when they worked together to follow an instruction worksheet about hands-on magnetic materials. This study presents data on the discourse characteristics of children's code switching, and the functions that Spanish and English have according to context. In addition, the data are described in relation to children's language competence and preference. The study found that code switching occurred both within and across turns. The older children's switches were more frequent and were deployed for a wider variety of functions than the younger children's. The results challenge the negative view that code switching by children who are learning two languages is due to lack of proficiency, and instead support the view that it is used as a strategy to extend their communicative competence during peer interaction.},

Its primary aim is to introduce R as a research instrument in quantitative Interactional Linguistics. Focusing on visualization in R, the book presents original case studies on conversational talk-in-interaction based on corpus data and explains in good detail how key graphs in the case studies were programmed in R. It also includes task sections to enable readers to conduct their own research and compute their own visualizations in R. Both the code underlying the key graphs in the case studies and the datasets used in the case studies as well as in the task sections are made available on the book's companion website.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an analysis of a corpus of American television programmes, comprising 930 texts from 191 different TV programmes (excluding commercial breaks and infomercials), totalling 5,320,159 tokens. This analysis compares different programme types (live politics, movies, news desk, reality shows, etc.) against one another and against nontelevisual registers (face-to-face conversations, telephone conversations, prepared speeches, press reviews, etc.), using the multidimensional (MD) approach to register variation (Biber, 1988). The goal of this analysis is to determine how homogeneous/heterogeneous the language of television is as well as to how it compares to the registers of English (Biber, 1988). We sought to detect both the similarities and differences among the TV registers and with respect to the five major dimensions of register variation previously identified by Biber (1988). Linguistic studies of television language to date (e.g., Al-Surmi, 2012; Bednarek, 2010; Quaglio, 2009; and Rey, 2001) have generally focussed on few or individual TV registers. This study provides a much more comprehensive view of American television discourse by relying on a large multi-register corpus optimised for representativeness through the application of Biber's (1993) method for sampling adequacy. The results show distinct differences among the registers' dimensions, suggesting that, on the whole, present-day American TV language is varied and patterned. In addition, the findings indicate that several TV registers have close counterparts in off-screen communication, such as conversations, speeches and interviews. All things considered, this study shows in detail the contact and separation points across different TV registers, as well as across TV and off-screen registers.},

To achieve this objective, this study analyzes the oral communication forms used by the candidates during the TV debates. When considering the most frequent lemmas, the candidates can be split into two groups, one using more frequently the pronoun `I', and the second favoring more the `we' (which corresponds to candidates leaving the presidential run sooner). According to several overall stylistic indicators, candidate Trump clearly adopted a simple and direct communication style, avoiding complex formulation and vocabulary. From a topical perspective, our analysis generates a map showing the affinities between candidates. This investigation results in the presence of three distinct groups of candidates, the first one with the Democrats (Clinton, O'Malley, and Sanders), the second with three Republicans (Bush, Cruz, Rubio), and the last with the duo Trump and Kasich, with, at a small distance, Paul. The over-used terms and typical sentences associated with each candidate reveal their specific topics such as `simple flat tax' for Cruz, `balanced budget' for Kasich, negativity with Trump, or critiques against large corporations and Wall Street for Sanders.},

  abstract = {Introduction The evaluation of information is a key element in information literacy, statistical literacy and data literacy. As such, all three literacies are inter-related. It is difficult to promote information literacy or data literacy without promoting statistical literacy. While their relative importance varies with one's perspective, these three literacies are united in dealing with similar problems that face students in college. More attention is needed on how these three literacies relate and how they may be taught synergistically. All librarians are interested in information literacy; archivists and data librarians are interested in data literacy. Both should consider teaching statistical literacy as a service to students who need to critically evaluate information in arguments. Information Literacy The need for information literacy has been highlighted in the US by several organizations including the American Library Association (ALA). In 1989 a call for information literacy was issued by the ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. 2 In 1989, the National Forum on Information Literacy 3 was formed. And in 1998, the ALA/ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries) issued a progress report. 4 Each organization and each report had some differences in their approach to information literacy. But one element was common to all -- the need for the critical evaluation of information. The ALA and ACRL issued a set of information literacy competency standards for higher education. 5 Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring indi-viduals to " recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information. " An information literate individual is able to: (1) Determine the extent of information needed, (2) Access the needed information effectively and efficiently, (3) Evaluate information and its sources critically, (4) Incorporate selected in-formation into one's knowledge base, (5) Use informa-tion effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and (6) Understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally. In their presentation of the standards for information literacy, the American Association of School Librarians Association (AASL) for Educational Communications and Technology presented evaluation as one of three standards},

To address this question, this paper analyzes 381,609 speeches given by politicians from five parliaments, by twelve European prime ministers, as well as speeches from party congresses over time and across countries. Our results replicate and generalize earlier findings: speakers from culturally liberal parties use more complex language than speakers from culturally conservative parties. Economic left-right differences, on the other hand, are not systematically linked to linguistic complexity.},

The participants were recruited using multistage sampling of adults in the UK during March and April 2015. The multistage sampling consisted of three stages. At the first stage a sample of postal districts in the UK was selected at random, with the probability of selection proportional to size. Within each district, a random sample of private households was selected. In households with more than one adult, one person was selected at random. Face to face interviews were carried out with 2872 adults.1 Of the 2872 respondents, 72\% (95\% confidence interval 70\% to 74\%) did not consider any of the following to be an invasion of their privacy by the National Cancer Registry: inclusion of postcode, inclusion of name and address, or the receipt of a letter inviting them to a research study on the basis of inclusion in the registry.

The findings of the case study suggest that anglicisms may function as prestige markers in Argentina, which may be a logical consequence of the mode of contact: those of upper socio-economic status have greater access to outlets where loanwords seem to emerge, such as the media, Internet, and second language education.},

  abstract = {The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States remains among the most significant social and political movements in US history. Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on the role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black press, with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings, we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations -- the introduction of new usages of specific words -- and which newspapers tended to follow. We then aggregate the evidence across hundreds of changes into a weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a lexical semantic change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical semantic influence, distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through this period. More specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women -- THE PROVINCIAL FREEMAN and THE LILY -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus, lending additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.},

The method is framed in a construction-based approach to language, i.e. it assumes that grammar consists of signs (form-meaning pairs) and is thus not fundamentally different from the lexicon. Themethod is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). Themethod has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying themeaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.},

Research into language ideologies concerning NNESs in the US suggests that such complaints can be understood as manifestations of a broader project of social exclusion operating, in part, through the ideological construction of the NNES as incomprehensible Other. The present study explores the extent to which such ideological presuppositions and exaggerative performances are observable in students' evaluations of `Asian' mathematics instructors on the website RateMyProfessors.com (RMP). A mixed methodological approach combining statistical analysis of numeric RMP ratings, quantitative corpus linguistic techniques, and critical discourse analysis was employed. Findings confirm the presence of disadvantages related to `Asian' instructors' race and language. However, RMP users' discourse is shown to be less overtly discriminatory and instead to reproduce dominant language ideology in subtle, previously undescribed ways.(Student evaluations, higher education, university teaching, nonnative speakers, second language users, ethnicity, critical discourse analysis, corpus linguistics, formulaic language)*},

Additionally, FPs after stronger breaks tend to occur phraseinitially, whereas the majority of the FPs after weak boundaries are in phrase-internal position. Also, acoustic observations reveal that FPs at major discourse boundaries are both segmentally and prosodically distinct.

  abstract = {In this paper we examine the frequency of the active and passive verb forms in two astrophysics journal articles, finding that we plus an active verb occurs at least as frequently as the passive in both articles. On the basis of consultation with an informant in astrophysics we find that astrophysics papers typify a previously unidentified type of research article, the logical argument scientific paper; in this type of paper, the rhetorical structure is quite different from that of the `standard scientific' experimental paper. Within the structure of the logical argument paper, we propose four rhetorical functions of the passive as opposed to we plus an active verb: (1) we indicates the author's procedural choice, while the passive indicates an established or standard procedure; (2) we is used to describe the author's own work and the passive to describe the work of others, unless that work is not mentioned in contrast to the author's in which case the active is used; (3) the passive is used to describe the author's proposed studies; and (4) the use of the active or the passive is determined by focus due to the length of an element or the need for emphasis. We suggest that similar uses of the passive and active voice may also extend to English journal papers in other fields, particularly those in which the subject matter does not lend itself to experimentation, and in which papers take the form of a logical argument rather than an experimental study. We review evidence produced subsequent to this study which suggests that astrophysics papers written in Russian may use the equivalent of the passive and active voice in a similar way to that described for English.},

In this article, we focus on the issue of variable selection in regression modeling. It is common to aim for a ``minimal adequate model'' and eliminate ``non-significant'' variables by statistical procedures. We advocate an alternative, ``deductive modeling'' approach that retains a ``full'' model of variables generated from our research questions and objectives. Comparing the statistical model to a camera, i.e.,~a tool to produce an image of reality, we contrast the deductive and predictive (minimal) modeling approaches on a dataset from a corpus study. While a minimal adequate model is more parsimonious, its selection procedure is blind to the research aim and may conceal relevant information. Deductive models, by contrast, are grounded in theory, have higher transparency (all relevant variables are reported) and potentially a greater accuracy of the reported effects. They are useful for answering research questions more directly, as they rely explicitly on prior knowledge and hypotheses, and allow for estimation and comparison across datasets.},

UHM was much less frequent than in British English with 7.5 vs. 14.5 instances per million words in the British National Corpus. However, as in British English the frequency of UHM was closely correlated to extra-linguistic context. Conversations in non-private environments (such as offices and classrooms) had higher frequencies than those taking place in private spaces, mostly homes. Time required for planning, especially when difficult subjects were discussed, appeared to be an important explanatory factor. It is clear that UHM cannot be dismissed as mere hesitation or disfluency; it functions as a pragmatic marker on a par with               well               ,               you know               , and               I mean               , sharing some of the functions of these in discourse.

Two types are distinguished, depending on sentence placement: in initial position, uh, um and er are attitude adverbs and in medial position, they are style adverbs.

As baselines, we train several recurrent neural network models on acceptability classification, and find that our models outperform unsupervised models by Lau et al. (2016) on CoLA. Error-analysis on specific grammatical phenomena reveals that both Lau et al.'s models and ours learn systematic generalizations like subject-verb-object order. However, all models we test perform far below human level on a wide range of grammatical constructions.},

They allow packaging up all code and dependencies to ensure that analyses run reliably across a range of operating systems and software versions. Despite being a crucial component for reproducible science, containerization has yet to become mainstream in psychology. In this tutorial, we describe the logic behind containers, what they are, and the practical problems they can solve. We walk the reader through the implementation of containerization within a research workflow with examples using Docker and R. Specifically, we describe how to use existing containers, build personalized containers, and share containers alongside publications. We provide a worked example that includes all steps required to set up a container for a research project and can easily be adapted and extended. We conclude with a discussion of the possibilities afforded by the large-scale adoption of containerization, especially in the context of cumulative, open science, toward a more efficient and inclusive research ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Corpus-based Translation Studies focuses on translation as a product by comparing comparable corpora of translated and non-translated texts. A number of distinctive features of translations have been posited including, for example, explicitation, simplification, normalisation, levelling out, source language interference, and under-representation of target language unique items. Nevertheless, research of this area has until recently been confined largely to translational English and closely related European languages. If the features of translational language that have been reported on the basis of these languages are to be generalised as 'translation universals', the language pairs involved must not be restricted to English and closely related European languages. Clearly, evidence from a genetically distant language pair such as English and Chinese is arguably more convincing, if not indispensable. This article explores, in the broad context of translation universal research, lexical and grammatical properties of translational Chinese on the basis of two one-million-word balanced comparable corpora of translated and non-translated native Chinese texts. The findings of this empirical study of the properties of translational Chinese have enabled a reevaluation, from the perspective of translational Chinese, of largely English-based translation universal hypotheses.

  abstract = {Abstract This study compares the syntactic complexity between translational and non-translational English across four genres (i.e. fiction, news, general prose, and academic prose) and examines the connections between various forms and degrees of syntactic complexity measures and explicitation. Fourteen syntactic complexity indices were examined based on a one-million-word translational English corpus (COTE) and a one-million-word non-translational English corpus (i.e. FLOB), respectively. This study shows that syntactic explicitation in translations varies with the formality of discourse. The most significant complexity difference between translational vis-{\`a}-vis non-translational English is found in fiction, which is regarded as the major contributor to translational English syntactic complexity. No significant difference in syntactic complexity was observed between the two types of academic English texts. Translational English news and general prose stand between fiction and academic texts. Translational fiction and news are characterised by more phrasal complexity features such as coordinate and complex nominal phrases, and a key indicator of translational English general prose complexity is subordination. The findings of this study will help students of translation to make informed decisions on the arrangement of sentence structures when given texts of different genres.},

Even though many languages possess a whole range of connectives, important divergences exist cross-linguistically in the number of connectives that are used to express a given relation. For this reason, connectives are not easily paired with a univocal translation equivalent across languages. This paper is a first attempt to design a reliable method to annotate the meaning of discourse connectives cross-linguistically using corpus data. We present the methodological choices made to reach this aim and report three annotation experiments using the framework of the Penn Discourse Tree Bank.},
