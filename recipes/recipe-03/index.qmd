## Concepts and strategies

In this Recipe, we will use the `PassiveBrownFam` dataset from {corpora} [@R-corpora]. This dataset contains information on the passive voice usage in the Brown family of corpora. The dataset contains 11 variables and 2,449 observations.

I have assigned this dataset to the object `brown_fam_df` and have made minor modifications to the variable names to improve the readability of the dataset.

<!-- [ ] code folding/ hiding? -->

```{r}
#| label: read-brown-fam
#| message: false
# Load packages
library(dplyr)

# Read the dataset from {corpora}
brown_fam_df <-
  corpora::PassiveBrownFam |> # reference the dataset
  as_tibble() # convert to a tibble

# Rename variables
brown_fam_df <-
  brown_fam_df |> # pass the original dataset
  rename( # rename variables: new_name = old_name
    lang_variety = lang,
    num_words = n.words,
    active_verbs = act,
    passive_verbs = pass,
    total_verbs = verbs,
    percent_passive = p.pass
  )

# Preview
glimpse(brown_fam_df)

```

You can learn more about these variables by reading the dataset documentation with `?corpora::PassiveBrownFam`.

### Statistical overviews

Understanding our data is of utmost importance before, during, and after analysis. After we get to know our data by inspecting the data origin, dictionary, and structure, we then move to summarizing the data.

A statistical overview of the data is a good place to start as it gives us a sense of all of the variables and variable types in the dataset. We can use {skimr} to create a statistical overview of the data, using the very convienent `skim()` function.

Let's create a statistical overview of the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

<!-- [ ] skim output in rmd show a Table for part, fix -->

```r
# Load packages
library(skimr)

# Create a statistical overview of the `brown_fam_df` dataset
skim(brown_fam_df)
```

```{r comment = "#"}
#| label: skim-brown-fam
#| echo: false

# Load packages
library(skimr)

# Create a statistical overview of the `brown_fam_df` dataset
skim(brown_fam_df) |> capture.output() |> cat(sep = "\n")

```

The output of the `skim()` function contains a lot of information but it essentially has two parts: a summary of the dataset and a summary of each variable in the dataset. The summary of each of the variables, however, is grouped by variable type. Remember, each of our variables in a data frame is a vector and each vector has a type.

We have already learned about different types of vectors in R, including character, numeric, and logical. In this dataset, we are presented with a new type of vector: a factor. A factor is essentially a character vector that contains a set of discrete values, or levels. Factors can be ordered or unordered and can contain levels that are not present in the data.

Now, looking at each of the variable types, we can see that we have 1 character variable, 5 factor variables, and 5 numeric variables. Each of these variable types assume a different set of summary statistics. For example, we can calculate the mean of a numeric variable but not of a character variable. Or, we can count the number of unique values in a character variable but not in a numeric variable.

For all variables, `skim()` will also provide the number of missing values and the percent of non-missing values.

Inspecting the entire dataset is a good place to start but at some point we often want focus in on a set of variables. We can add the `yank()` function to extract the statistical overview of a set of variables by their variable types.

Let's extract the statistical overview of the numeric variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: yank-brown-fam
#| eval: false

# Extract the statistical overview of the numeric variables
brown_fam_df |>
  skim() |>
  yank("numeric")
```

```plain

```

### Summary statistics of particular variables

These summary statistics are useful but for a preliminary and interactive use, but it is oftent the case that we will want to focus in on a particular variable or set of variables and their potential relationships to other variables.

We can use {dplyr} to calculate summary statistics for a particular variable or set of variables. We can use the `group_by()` function to group the data by a particular variable or variables. Then we can use the `summarize()` function to calculate summary statistics for the grouped data.

For example, let's calculate the mean and median of the `percent_passive` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset grouped by the `lang_variety` variable.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-lang-variety

# Mean and median of `percent_passive` grouped by `lang_variety`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(lang_variety) |>
  summarize(
    mean_percent_passive = mean(percent_passive),
    median_percent_passive = median(percent_passive)
  )
```

The result is a 2x3 data frame which includes both the mean and median of the `percent_passive` variable for each of the two levels of the `lang_variety` variable.

The `group_by()` function can also be used to group by multiple variables. For example, let's calculate the mean and median of the `percent_passive` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset grouped by the `lang_variety` and `genre` variables.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-lang-variety-genre

# Mean and median of `percent_passive` grouped by
# `lang_variety` and `genre`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(lang_variety, genre) |>
  summarize(
    mean_percent_passive = mean(percent_passive),
    median_percent_passive = median(percent_passive)
  )
```

For numeric variables, such as `percent_passive`, there are a number of summary statistics that we can calculate. We've seen the R functions for mean and median but we can also calculate the standard deviation (`sd()`), variance (`var()`), minimum (`min()`), maximum (`max()`), interquartile range (`IQR()`), median absolute deviation (`mad()`), and quantiles (`quantile()`). All these calculations make sense for numeric variables but not for character variables.

For character variables, and factors, the summary statistics are more limited. We can calculate the number of observations (`n()`) and/ or the number of unique values (`n_distinct()`). Let's now summarize the number of observations `n()` grouped by the `genre` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-genre-n-distinct

# Frequency table for `genre`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(genre) |>
  summarize(
    n = n(),
  )
```

Just as before, we can add multiple grouping variables to `group_by()`. Let's add `lang_variety` to the grouping and calculate the number of observations `n()` grouped by the `genre` and `lang_variety` variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-genre-lang-variety-n-distinct

# Cross-tabulation for `genre` and `lang_variety`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(genre, lang_variety) |>
  summarize(
    n = n(),
  )
```

::: {.callout .halfsize}
**{{< fa regular hand-point-up >}} Tip**

The result of calculating the number of observations for a character or factor variable is known as a frequency table. Grouping two or more categorical variables is known as a cross-tabulation or a contingency table.
:::

Now, we can also pipe the results of a `group_by()` and `summarize()` to another function. This can be to say sort, select, or filter the results. It can also be to perform another summary function. It is important, however, to remember that the result of a `group_by()` produces a grouped data frame. Subsequent functions will be applied to the grouped data frame. This can lead to unexpected results if the original grouping is not relevant for the subsequent function. To avoid this, we can use the `ungroup()` function to remove the grouping after the relevant grouped summary statistics have been calculated.

Let's return to calculating the number of observations `n()` grouped by the `genre` and `lang_variety` variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset. But let's add another summary which uses the `n` variable to calculate the mean and median number of observations.

If we do not use the `ungroup()` function, the mean and median will be calculated for each `genre` collapsed across `lang_variety`.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-genre-n-distinct-mean-median

# Mean and median of `n` grouped by `genre`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(genre, lang_variety) |>
  summarize(
    n = n(),
  ) |>
  summarize(
    mean_n = mean(n),
    median_n = median(n)
  )
```

Therefore we see that we have a mean and median calculated for the number of documents in the corpus for each of the 15 genres.

If we use the `ungroup()` function, the mean and median will be calculated for all genres. Note we will use the `ungroup()` function between these summaries to clear the grouping before calculating the mean and median.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-brown-fam-genre-n-mean-median

# Number of observations for each `genre` and `lang_variety`
brown_fam_df |>
  group_by(genre, lang_variety) |>
  summarize(
    n = n(),
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  summarize(
    mean_n = mean(n),
    median_n = median(n)
  )
```

Now we see that we have a mean and median calculated across all genres.

----

Before we leave this section, let's look some other ways to create frequency and contingency tables for character and factor variables. A shortcut to calculate a frequency table for a character or factor variable is to use the `count()` function from {dplyr}.

Let's calculate the number of observations grouped by the `genre` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: count-brown-fam-genre

# Frequency table for `genre`
brown_fam_df |>
  count(genre)
```

We can also add multiple grouping variables to `count()` and create contingency tables.

Let's add `lang_variety` to the grouping and create a cross-tabulation for `genre` and `lang_variety` variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: count-brown-fam-genre-lang-variety

# Cross-tabulation for `genre` and `lang_variety`
brown_fam_df |>
  count(genre, lang_variety)
```

Note that the results of `count()` are not grouped so we do not need to use the `ungroup()` function before calculating subsequent summary statistics.

Another way to create frequency and contingency tables is to use the `tabyl()` function from {janitor} [@R-janitor]. Let's create a frequency table for the `genre` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: tabyl-brown-fam-genre

# Load packages
library(janitor)

# Frequency table for `genre`
brown_fam_df |>
  tabyl(genre)
```

In addition to providing frequency counts, the `tabyl()` function also provides the percent of observations for each level of the variable. And, we can add up to three grouping variables to `tabyl()` as well.

Let's add `lang_variety` to the grouping and create a contingency table for the `genre` and `lang_variety` variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: tabyl-brown-fam-genre-lang-variety

# Cross-tabulation for `genre` and `lang_variety`
brown_fam_df |>
  tabyl(genre, lang_variety)
```

The results do not include the percent of observations for each level of the variable as it is not clear how to calculate the percent of observations for each level of the variable when there are multiple grouping variables. We must specify if we want to calculate the percent of observations by row or by column.

{janitor} includes a variety of `adorn_*()` functions to add additional information to the results of `tabyl()`, including percentages, frequencies, and totals. Feel free to explore these functions on your own. We will return to this topic again later in the course.

### Creating Quarto tables

Summarizing the data is not only useful for our understanding of the data as part of our analysis but also for communicating the data in reports, manuscripts, and presentations.

One way to communicate summary statistics is with tables. In Quarto, we can use {knitr} [@R-knitr] in combination with code block options to produce formatted tables which we can cross-reference in our prose sections.

Let's create an object from the cross-tabulation for the `genre` and `lang_variety` variables in the `brown_fam_df` dataset to work with.

```{r}
#| label: tabyl-brown-genre-lang-cross-tab

# Cross-tabulation for `genre` and `lang_variety`
bf_genre_lang_ct <-
  brown_fam_df |>
  tabyl(genre, lang_variety)
```

To create a table in Quarto, we use the `kable()` function. The `kable()` function takes a data frame (or matrix) as an argument. The `format` argument will be derived from the Quarto document format ('html', 'pdf', *etc.*).

```{r}
#| label: kable-brown-genre-lang-cross-tab

# Load packages
library(knitr)

# Create a table in Quarto
kable(bf_genre_lang_ct)
```

To add a caption to the table and to enable cross-referencing, we use the code block options `label` and `tbl-cap`. The `label` option takes a label prefixed with `tbl-` to create a cross-reference to the table. The `tbl-cap` option takes a caption for the table, in quotation marks.

```r
#| label: tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct
#| tbl-cap: "Cross-tabulation of `genre` and `lang_variety`"

# Create a table in Quarto
kable(bf_genre_lang_ct)
```

Now we can cross-reference the table with the `@tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct` syntax. So the following Quarto document will produce the following prose with a cross-reference to the formatted table output.

````yaml

As we see in @tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct, the distribution of `genre` is similar across `lang_variety`.

```{r}`r ''`
#| label: tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct
#| tbl-cap: "Cross-tabulation of `genre` and `lang_variety`"

# Print cross-tabulation
kable(bf_genre_lang_ct)
```

````

----

As we see in @tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct-example, the distribution of `genre` is similar across `lang_variety`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-brown-genre-lang-ct-example
#| tbl-cap: "Cross-tabulation of `genre` and `lang_variety`"
#| echo: false

kable(
  bf_genre_lang_ct
)
```

{kableExtra} [@R-kableExtra] provides additional functionality for formatting tables in Quarto.

### Creating Quarto plots

Where tables are useful for communicating summary statistics for numeric and character variables, plots are useful for communicating relationships between variables especially when one or more of the variables is numeric. Furthermore, for complex relationships, plots can be more effective than tables.

In Quarto, we can use {ggplot2} [@R-ggplot2] in combination with code block options to produce formatted plots which we can cross-reference in our prose sections.

Let's see this in action with a simple histogram of the `percent_passive` variable in the `brown_fam_df` dataset. The Quarto document will produce the following prose with a cross-reference to the formatted plot output.

````yaml
As we see in @fig-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist, the distribution of `percent_passive` is skewed to the right.

```{r}`r ''`
#| label: fig-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of `percent_passive`"

# Create a histogram in Quarto
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = percent_passive))
```

````

----

As we see in @fig-ggplot2-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist-example, the distribution of `percent_passive` is skewed to the right.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ggplot2-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist-example
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of `percent_passive`"
#| echo: false

# Create a histogram
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = percent_passive))
```

----

{ggplot2} implements the 'Grammar of Graphics' approach to creating plots. This approach is based on the idea that plots can be broken down into components, or layers, and that each layer can be manipulated independently.

The main components are data, aesthetics, and geometries. Data is the data frame that contains the variables to be plotted. Aesthetics are the variables that will be mapped to the x-axis, y-axis (as well as color, shape, size, *etc.*). Geometries are the visual elements that will be used to represent the data, such as points, lines, bars, *etc.*.

As discussed in the R lesson "Visual Summaries", the `aes()` function is used to map variables to aesthetics and can be added to the `ggplot()` function or to the `geom_*()` function depending on whether the aesthetic is mapped to all geometries or to a specific geometry, respectively.

Take a look at the following stages of the earlier plot in each of the tabs below.

#### Stages

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Data

The data layer does not produce a plot but it is the foundation of the plot.

```{r ggplot2-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist-data}
# Data layer
ggplot(brown_fam_df)
```

## Aesthetics

The aesthetics layer does not produce a plot but it maps the variables to the aesthetics to be used in the plot.

```{r ggplot2-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist-aes}
# Aesthetics layer
ggplot(brown_fam_df, aes(x = percent_passive))
```

## Geometries

The geometries layer produces the plot connecting the data and aesthetics layers in the particular way specified by the geometries, in this case a histogram.

```{r ggplot2-brown-fam-percent-passive-hist-geom}
# Geometries layer
ggplot(brown_fam_df, aes(x = percent_passive)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
:::

#### Choosing the right plot

Just as with tables, the type of summary we choose to communicate with a plot depends on the type of variables we are working with and the relationships between those variables.

Below I've included a few examples of plots that can be used to communicate different types of variables and relationships.


#### Single numeric variable

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Histogram
```{r plot-single-hist}
# Histogram
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = percent_passive))
```

## Density plot
```{r plot-single-density}
# Density plot
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = percent_passive))
```
:::

#### Numeric and categorical variables

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Density plot
```{r plot-numeric-categorical-density}
# Density plot
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_density(
    aes(
      x = percent_passive,
      fill = lang_variety
    ),
    alpha = 0.5 # adds transparency
  )
```

## Boxplot
```{r plot-numeric-categorical-boxplot}
# Boxplot
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(
      x = lang_variety,
      y = percent_passive
    )
  )
```

## Violin plot
```{r plot-numeric-categorical-violin}
# Violin plot
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_violin(
    aes(
      x = lang_variety,
      y = percent_passive
    )
  )
```
:::

#### Two numeric variables

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Scatterplot
```{r plot-two-scatter}
# Scatterplot
ggplot(brown_fam_df) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = active_verbs,
      y = passive_verbs
    )
  )
```

## Scatterplot with regression line
```{r plot-two-scatter-regression}
# Scatterplot with regression line
ggplot(
  brown_fam_df,
  aes(
    x = active_verbs,
    y = passive_verbs
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
:::

#### Other variable combinations

In these examples, we have only looked at the most common variable combinations for one and two variable plots. There are more sophisticated plots that can be used for other variable combinations using {ggplot2}. For now, we will leave these for another time.

## Check your understanding

1. A factor is a character vector augmented to include information about the discrete values, or levels, of the vector. `r torf(TRUE)`
2. What is the difference between a frequency table and a contingency table? `r mcq(c("A frequency table is a cross-tabulation of two or more categorical variables.", answer = "A contingency table is a cross-tabulation of two or more categorical variables."))`
3. The `r mcq(c("skimr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", answer = "knitr"))` package is used to create formatted tables in R.
4. To add a geometry layer, such as `geom_histogram()`, to a ggplot object the `|>` operator is used. `r torf(FALSE)`
5. To visualize the relationship between two numeric variables, a `r mcq(c("histogram", "density plot", "boxplot", "violin plot", answer = "scatterplot"))` is often used.
6. When the `aes()` function is added to the `ggplot()` function, the aesthetic is mapped to all geometries. `r torf(TRUE)`
