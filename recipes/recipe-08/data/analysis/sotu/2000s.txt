formula it hold state and school district accountable for progress and reward them for result each year our national government invest much than billion in our school it be time to support what work and stop support what doesn't now as we demand much from our school we should also invest much in our school let's double our investment to help state and district turn around their bad perform school

college affordable for all if we take all this step we'll move a long way toward make sure every child start school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed we also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen family by give every parent the tool to succeed at work and at the much important work of all raise child that mean make sure every family have health care and the support to care for age parent the tool to bring their child up right and that no child grow up in poverty from my first day as president we've work to give family good access to good health care in

our way to our goal of million but there be still much than million of our fellow american without health insurance much than there be in tonight i propose that we follow vice president gore's suggestion to make low income parent eligible for the insurance that cover their child together with our children's initiative think of this together with our children's initiative this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in america again i want to ask you to let people between the age of and the fast grow group of uninsured buy into medicare and this year i propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice a affordable one i hope you will support that as good when the baby boomer retire medicare will be face with care for twice as many of our citizen yet it be far from ready to do so my generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden we simply must act now to strengthen and modernize medicare my budget include a comprehensive plan to reform medicare to make it much efficient and much competitive and it dedicate nearly billion of our budget surplus to keep medicare solvent past and at long last it also provide fund to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drug lifesaving drug be a indispensable part of modern medicine no one create a medicare program today would even think of exclude coverage for prescription drug yet much than three in five of our senior now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their life million of old american who need prescription drug the much pay the high price for them in good conscience we cannot let another year pass without extend to all our senior this lifeline of affordable prescription drug record number of american be provide for age or ail love one at home it's a love but a difficult and often very expensive choice last year i propose a tax credit for long term care frankly it wasn't enough this year let's triple it to but this year let's pass it we also have to make need investment to expand access to mental health care i want to take a moment to thank the person who lead our first white house conference on mental health last year and who for year have lead all our effort to break down the barrier to decent treatment of people with mental illness thank you tipper gore take together this proposal would mark the large investment in health care in the year since medicare be create the large investment in year that would be a big step toward assure quality health care for all american young and old and i ask you to embrace them and pass them we must also make investment that reward work and support family nothing do that good than the earn income tax credit the eitc the e in the eitc be about earn work take responsibility and be reward for it in my very first address to you i ask congress to greatly expand this credit and you do as a result in alone the eitc help much than million american work their way out of poverty toward the middle class that's double the numb in tonight i propose another major expansion of the eitc to reduce the marriage penalty to make sure it reward marriage as it reward work and also to expand the tax credit for family that have much than two child it punish people with much than two child today our proposal would allow family with three or much child to get up to much in tax relief this be work family their child should not be in poverty we also can't reward work and family unless man and woman get equal pay for equal work today the female unemployment rate be the low it have be in year yet woman still only earn about cent for every dollar man earn we must do good by provide the resource to enforce present equal pay law train much woman for high pay high tech job and pass the paycheck fairness act many work parent spend up to a quar ter a quarter of their income on child care last year we help parent provide child care for about million child my child care initiative before you now along with fund already secure in welfare reform would make child care good safe and much affordable for another child i ask you to pass that they need it out there for hard press middle income family we should also expand the child care tax credit and i believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income family for people make under a year that can mean up to for child care cost you know we all say we're pro work and pro family pass this proposal would prove it ten of million of american live from paycheck to paycheck as hard as they work they still don't have the opportunity to save too few can make use of ira's and 401k plan we should do much to help all work family save and accumulate wealth that's the idea behind the individual development account the ida's i ask you to take that idea to a new level with new retirement saving account that enable every low and moderate income family in america to save for retirement a first home a medical emergency or a college education i propose to match their contribution however small dollar for dollar every year they save and i propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its worker that people ought to have retirement as good as the rest of us nearly one in three american child grow up without a father this child be time much likely to live in poverty than child with both parent at home clearly demand and support responsible fatherhood be critical to lift all our child out of poverty we've double child support collection since and i'm propose to you tough new measure to hold still much father responsible but we should recognize that a lot of

now again i say to you this be step but step by step we can go a long way toward our goal of bring opportunity to every community to realize the full possibility of this economy we must reach beyond our own border to shape the revolution that be tear down barrier and build new network among nation and individual and economy and culture globalization it's the central reality of our time of course change this profound be both liberate and threaten to people but there's no turn back and our open creative society stand to benefit much than any other if we understand and act on the reality of interdependence we have to be at the center of every vital global network as a good neighbor and a good partner we have to recognize that we cannot build our future without help other to build theirs the first thing we have get to do be to forge a new consensus on trade now that of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade we have to ensure that it lift both our live standard and our value never tolerate abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection but other must recognize that open market and rule base trade be the good engine we know of for raise live standard reduce global poverty and environmental destruction and assure the free flow of idea i believe as strongly tonight as i do the first day i get here the only direction forward for america on trade the only direction for america on trade be to keep go forward i ask you to help me forge that consensus we have to make develop economy our partner in prosperity that's why i would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking african and caribbean basin trade initiative but globalization be about much than economics our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose that who would tear it apart here be the fundamental challenge i believe america must meet to shape the 21st century world first we must continue to encourage our former adversary russia and china to emerge as stable prosperous democratic nation both be be hold back today from reach their full potential russia by the legacy of communism a economy in turmoil a cruel and self defeat war in chechnya china by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom but think how much have change in the past decade former soviet nuclear weapon take out of commission russian soldier actually serve with ours in the balkans russian people elect their leader for the first time in year and in china a economy much open to the world than ever before of course no one not a single person in this chamber tonight can know for sure what direction this great nation will take but we do know for sure that we can choose what we do and we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely to be constructive member of our global community that's why we should support that russian who be struggle for a democratic prosperous future continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenal and help russia to safeguard weapon and material that remain and that's why i believe congress should support the agreement we negotiate to bring china into the wto by pass permanent normal trade relation with china as soon as possible this year i think you ought to do it for two reason first of all our market be already open to china this agreement will open china's market to us and 2 it will plainly advance the cause of peace in asia and promote the cause of change in china no we don't know where it's go all we can do be decide what we're go to do but when all be say and do we need to know we do everything we possibly can to maximize the chance that china will choose the right future a 2 challenge we've get be to protect our own security from conflict that pose the risk of wide war and threaten our common humanity we can't prevent every conflict or stop every outrage but where our interest be at stake and we can make a difference we should be and we must be peacemaker we should be proud of our role in bring the middle east close to a last peace build peace in northern ireland work for peace in east timor and africa promote reconciliation between greece and turkey and in cyprus work to defuse this crisis between india and pakistan in defend human right and religious freedom and we should be proud of the man and woman of our arm force and that of our ally who stop the ethnic cleanse in kosovo enable a million people to return to their home when slobodan milosevic unleash his terror on kosovo captain john cherrey be one of the brave airman who turn the tide and when another american plane be shoot down over serbia he fly into the tooth of enemy air defense to bring his fellow pilot home thank to our arm force skill and bravery we prevail in kosovo without lose a single american in combat i want to introduce captain cherrey to you we honor captain cherrey and we promise you captain we'll finish the job you begin stand up so we can see you a 3 challenge we have be to keep this inexorable march of technology from give terrorist and potentially hostile nation the mean to undermine our defense keep in mind the same technological advance that have shrink cell phone to fit in the palm of our hand can also make weapon of terror easy to conceal and easy to use we must meet this threat by make effective agreement to restrain nuclear and missile program in north korea curb the flow of lethal technology to iran prevent iraq from threaten its neighbor increase our preparedness against chemical and biological attack protect our vital computer system from hacker and criminal and develop a system to defend against new missile threat while work to preserve our abm missile treaty with russia we must do all this thing i predict to you when much of us be long go but some time in the next to year the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemy of the nation state the narcotraffickers and the terrorist and the organize criminal who will be organize together work together with increase access to ever much sophisticate chemical and biological weapon and i want to thank the pentagon and other for do what they're do right now to try to help protect us and plan for that so that our defense will be strong i ask for your support to ensure they can succeed i also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which i hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty i hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that be present to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor we cannot accept a world in which part of humanity life on the cut edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival i think we have to do our part to change that with expand trade expand aid and the expansion of freedom this be interest from nigeria to indonesia much people get the right to choose their leader in than in when the berlin wall fall we've get to stand by this democracy include and especially tonight colombia which be fight narcotraffickers for its own people's life and our children's life i have propose a strong year package to help colombia win this fight i want to thank the leader in both party in both

budget i give you invest million much in the fight against this and other infectious killer and today i propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccine for disease like malaria tb and aid i

prevent disease for example researcher have identify gene that cause parkinson's diabetes and certain kind of cancer they be design precision therapy that will block the harmful effect of this gene for good researcher already be use this new technique to target and destroy cell that cause breast cancer soon we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of alzheimer's scientist be also work on a artificial retina to help many blind people to see and listen to this microchip that would actually directly stimulate damage spinal cord in a way that can allow people now paralyze to stand up and walk this kind of innovation be also propel our remarkable prosperity information technology only include percent of our employment but now account for a 3 of our economic growth along with job that

computer the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fast supercomputer to accelerate the march of discovery across all this discipline in science and technology i ask you to support my recommendation of a unprecedented billion in the 21st century research fund the large increase in civilian research in a generation we owe it to our future now this new breakthrough have to be use in

environment the economy in way we can't even imagine today but we all know that at a time when science technology and the force of globalization be bring so many change into all our life it's much important than ever that we strengthen the bond that root us in our local community and in our national community no tie bind different people together like citizen service there's a new spirit of service in america a movement we've try to support with americorps expand peace corp unprecedented new partnership with business foundation community group partnership for example like the one that enlist company which have now move of our fellow citizen from welfare to work partnership to battle drug abuse aid teach young people to read save america's treasure strengthen the art fight teen pregnancy prevent violence among young people promote racial heal the american people be work together but we should do much to help american help each other first we should help faith base organization to do much to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track with initiative like 2 chance home that do so much to help unwed teen mother 2 we should support american who tithe and contribute to charity but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it tonight i propose new tax incentive that would allow low and middle income citizen who don't itemize to get that deduction it's nothing but fair and it will get much people to give we should do much to help new immigrant to fully participate in our community that's why i recommend spend much to teach them civics and english and since everybody in our community count we've get to make sure everyone be count in this year's census within year just year there will be no majority race in our large state of california in a little much than year there will be no majority race in america in a much interconnect world this diversity can be our great strength just look around this chamber look around we have member in this congress from virtually every racial ethnic and religious background and i think you would agree that america be strong because of it you also have to agree that all that difference you just clap for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home just in the last couple of year we've see a man drag to death in texas just because he be black we see a young man murder in wyoming just because he be gay last year we see the shooting of african american asian american and jewish child just because of who they be this be not the american way and we must draw the line i ask you to draw that line by pass without delay the hate crime prevention act and the employment non discrimination act and i ask you to reauthorize the violence against woman act finally

and he say that we be all regardless of race genetically percent the same now you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here but it be worth remember we can laugh about this but you think about it modern science have confirm what ancient faith have always teach the much important fact of life be our common humanity therefore we should do much than just tolerate our diversity we should honor it and celebrate it my fellow american every time i prepare for the state of the union i approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our nation but tonight be very special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of american achievement and before us we can see even great grand frontier of possibility we should all of us be fill with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity we should be fill with awe and joy at what lie over the horizon and we should be fill with absolute determination to make the much of it you know when the framer finish craft our constitution in philadelphia benjamin franklin stand in independence hall and he reflect on the carve of the sun that be on the back of a chair he see the sun be low on the horizon so he say this he say i've often wonder whether that sun be rise or set today franklin say i have the happiness to know it's a rise sun today because each succeed generation of american have keep the fire of freedom burn brightly light that frontier of possibility we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of mr franklin's rise sun after year the

you who have accept my invitation to come to the white house to discuss important issue we're off to a good start i will continue to meet with you and ask for your input you have be kind and candid and i thank you for make a new president feel welcome the last time i visit the capitol i come to take a oath on the step of this build i pledge to honor our constitution and law and i ask you to join me in set a tone of civility and respect in washington i hope america be notice the difference because we're make progress together we be change the tone in the nation's capital and this spirit of respect and cooperation be vital because in the end we will be judge not only by what we say or how we say it we will be judge by what we're able to accomplish america today be a nation with great challenge but great resource a artist use statistic as a brush can paint two very different picture of our country one would have warn sign increase layoff rise energy price too many fail school persistent poverty the stubborn vestige of racism another picture would be full of blessing a balance budget big surplus a military that be 2 to none a country at peace with its neighbor technology that be revolutionize the world and our great strength concern citizen who care for our country and care for each other neither picture be complete in and of itself and tonight i challenge and invite congress to work with me to use the resource of one picture to repaint the other to direct the advantage of our time to solve the problem of our people some of this resource will come from government some but not all year after year in washington budget debate seem to come down to a old tire argument on one side that who want much government regardless of the cost on the other that who want little government regardless of the need we should leave that argument to the last century and chart a different course government have a role and a important role yet too much government crowd out initiative and hard work private charity and the private economy our new govern vision say government should be active but limit engage but not overbear and my budget be base on that philosophy it be reasonable and it be responsible it meet our obligation and fund our grow need we increase spend next year for social security and medicare and other entitlement program by billion we've increase spend for discretionary program by a very responsible percent above the rate of inflation my plan pay down a unprecedented amount of our national debt and then when money be still leave over my plan return it to the people who earn it in the first place a budget's impact be count in dollar but measure in life excellent school quality health care a secure retirement a clean environment a strong defense this be all important need and we fund them the high percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's education education be not my top priority education be my top priority and by support this budget you'll make it yours as good read be the foundation of all learn so during the next year we triple spend add billion to help every child in america learn to read value be important so we've triple fund for character education to teach our child not only read and write but right from wrong we've increase fund to train and recruit teacher because we know a good education start with a good teacher and i have a wonderful partner in this effort i like teacher so much i marry one laura have begin a new effort to recruit american to the profession that will shape our future teach she will travel across america to promote sound teach practice and early read skill in our school and in program such as head start when it come to our school dollar alone do not always make the difference fund be important and so be reform so we must tie fund to high standard and accountability for result i believe in local control of school we should not and we will not run public school from washington dc yet when the federal government spend tax dollar we must insist on result child should be test on basic read and math skill every year between grade three and eight measure be the only way to know whether all our child be learn and i want to know because i refuse to leave any child behind in america critic of test contend it distract from learn they talk about teach to the test but let's put that logic to the test if you test a child on basic math and read skill and you're teach to the test you're teach math and read and that's the whole idea as standard rise local school will need much flexibility to meet them so we must streamline the dozen of federal education program into five and let state spend money in that category as they see fit school will be give a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so yet if they don't if they continue to fail we must give parent and student different option a good public school a private school tutor or a charter school in the end every child in a bad situation must be give a good choice because when it come to our child failure be simply not a option another priority in my budget be to keep the vital promise of medicare and social security and together we will do so to meet the health care need of all america's senior we double the medicare budget over the next year my budget dedicate billion to medicare next year alone enough to fund all current program and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low income senior no senior in america should have to choose between buy food and buy prescription to make sure the retirement saving of america's senior be not divert into any other program my budget protect all trillion of the social security surplus for social security and for social security alone my budget put a priority on access to health care without tell american what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose many work american do not have health care coverage so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credit and to provide quality care in low income neighborhood over the next year we will double the numb of people serve at community health care center and we will address the concern of that who have health coverage yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay together this congress and this president will find common grind to make sure doctor make medical decision and patient get the health care they deserve with a patient bill of right when it come to their health people want to get the medical care they need not be force to go to court because they didn't get it we will ensure access to the court for that with legitimate claim but first let's put in place a strong independent review so we promote quality health care not frivolous lawsuit my budget also increase fund for medical research which give hope to many who struggle with serious disease our prayer tonight be with one of your own who be engage in his own fight against cancer a fine representative and a good man congressman joe moakley i can think of no much appropriate tribute to joe than to have the congress finish the job of double the budget for the national institute of health my new freedom initiative for american with disability fund new technology expand opportunity to work and make our society much welcome for the much than million american with disability we must continue to break down barrier to equality the budget i propose to you also support the people who keep our country strong and free the man and woman who serve in the unite state military i'm request billion in increase military pay and benefit and health care and house our man and woman in uniform give america their good and we owe them our support america's veteran honor their commitment to our country through their military service i will honor our commitment to them with a billion dollar increase to ensure good access to quality care and fast decision on benefit claim my budget will improve our environment by accelerate the cleanup of toxic brownfields and i propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully fund the land and water conservation fund our national park have a special place in our country's life our park be place of great natural beauty and history as good steward we must leave them good than we find them so i propose provide billion over year for the upkeep of this national treasure and my budget adopt a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantage we must encourage and support the work of charity and faith base and community group that offer help and love one person at a time this group be work in every neighborhood in america to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our child government should welcome this group to apply for fund not discriminate against them government cannot be replace by charity or volunteer government should not fund religious activity but our nation should support the good work of this good people who be help their neighbor in need so i propose allow all taxpayer whether they itemize or not to deduct their charitable contribution estimate show this can encourage as much as billion a year in new charitable give money that will save and change life our budget provide much than million over the next year for a federal compassion capital fund with a focus and noble mission to provide a mentor to the much than one million child with a parent in prison and to support other local effort to fight illiteracy teen pregnancy drug addiction and other difficult problem with us tonight be the mayor of philadelphia please help me welcome mayor john street mayor street have encourage faith base and community organization to make a significant difference in philadelphia he's invite me to his city this summer to see compassionate action i'm personally aware of just how effective the mayor be mayor street's a democrat let the record show i lose his city big time but some thing be big than politic so i look forward to come to your city to see your faith base program in action as government promote compassion it also must promote justice too many of our citizen have cause to doubt our nation's justice when the law point a finger of suspicion at group instead of individual all our citizen be create equal and must be treat equally early today i ask john ashcroft the attorney general to develop specific recommendation to end racial profile it's wrong and we will end it in america in so do we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officer they protect us every day often at great risk but by stop the abuse of a few we will add to the public confidence our police officer earn and deserve my budget have fund a responsible increase in our ongoing operation it have fund our nation's important priority it have protect social security and medicare and our surplus be big enough that there be still money leave over many of you have talk about the need to pay down our national debt i listen and i agree we owe it to our child and grandchild to act now and i hope you will join me to pay down trillion in debt during the next year at the end of that year we will have pay down all the debt that be available to retire that be much debt repay much quickly than have ever be repay by any nation at any time in history we should also prepare for the unexpected for the uncertainty of the future we should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family would with a contingency fund for emergency or additional spend need for example after a strategic review we may need to increase defense spend we may need to increase spend for our farmer or additional money to reform medicare and so my budget set aside almost a trillion dollar over year for additional need that be one trillion additional reason you can feel comfortable support this budget we have increase our budget at a responsible percent we have fund our priority we pay down all the available debt we have prepare for contingency and we still have money leave over yogi berra once say when you come to a fork in the road take it now we come to a fork in the road we have two choice even though we have already meet our need we can spend the money on much and big government that's the road our nation have travel in recent year last year government spend shoot up percent that's far much than our economy grow far much than personal income grow and far much than the rate of inflation if you continue on that road you will spend the surplus and have to dip into social security to pay other bill unrestrained government spend be a dangerous road to deficit so we must take a different path the other choice be to let the american people spend their own money to meet their own need i hope you will join me in stand firmly on the side of the people you see the grow surplus exist because tax be too high and government be charge much than it need the people of america have be overcharge and on their behalf i be here ask for a refund some say my tax plan be too big other say it's too small i respectfully disagree this plan be just right i didn't throw dart at a board to come up with a numb for tax relief i didn't take a poll or develop a arbitrary formula that may sound good i look at problem in the tax code and calculate the cost to fix them a tax rate of percent be too high for that who earn low wage so we must low the rate to percent no one should pay much than a 3 of the money they earn in federal income tax so we lower the top rate to percent this reform will be welcome relief for america's small business which often pay tax at the high rate and help for small business mean job for american we simplify the tax code by reduce the numb of tax rate from the current five rate to four low one percent and percent in my plan no one be target in or target out everyone who pay income tax will get relief our government should not tax and thereby discourage marriage so we reduce the marriage penalty i want to help family rear and support their child so we double the child credit to per child it's not fair to tax the same earnings twice once when you earn them and again when you die so we must repeal the death tax this change add up to significant help a typical family with two child will save a year on their federal income tax now may not sound like a lot to some but it mean a lot to many family buy gas for two car for a entire year it pay tuition for a year at a community college it pay the average family grocery bill for month that's real money with us tonight represent many american family be steven and josefina ramos they be from pennsylvania but they can be from any one of your district steven be the network administrator for a school district josefina be a spanish teacher at a charter school and they have a year old daughter steven and josefina tell me they pay almost a year in federal income tax my plan will save them much than let me tell you what steven say two thousand dollar a year mean a lot to my family if we have this money it would help us reach our goal of pay off our personal debt in year time after that steven and josefina want to start save for lianna's college education my attitude be government should never stand in the way of family achieve their dream and as we debate this issue always remember the surplus be not the government's money the surplus be the people's money for low income family my tax plan restore basic fairness right now complicate tax rule punish hard work a waitress support two child on a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earn above the her overtime her hard hour be tax at nearly percent this send a terrible message you'll never get ahead but america's message must be different we must honor hard work never punish it with tax relief overtime will no long be over tax time for the waitress people with the small income will get the high percentage of reduction and million of additional american family will be remove from the income tax roll entirely tax relief be right and tax relief be urgent the long economic expansion that begin almost year ago be falter low interest rate will eventually help but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves forty year ago and then year ago two president one democrat one republican john f kennedy and ronald reagan advocate tax cut to in president kennedy's word get this country move again they know then what we must do now to create economic growth and opportunity we must put money back into the hand of the people who buy good and create job we must act quickly the chairman of the federal reserve have testify before congress that tax cut often come too late to stimulate economic recovery so i want to work with you to give our economy a important jump start by make tax relief retroactive we must act now because it be the right thing to do we must also act now because we have other thing to do we must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenge to restructure our nation's defense to meet our grow need for energy and to reform medicare and social security america have a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promote a distinctly american internationalism we will work with our ally and friend to be a force for good and a champion of freedom we will work for free market free trade and freedom from oppression nation make progress toward freedom will find america be their friend we will promote our value we will promote the peace and we need a strong military to keep the peace but our military be shape to confront the challenge of the past so i've ask the secretary of defense to review america's arm force and prepare to transform them to meet emerge threat my budget make a downpayment on the research and development that will be require yet in our broad transformation effort we must put strategy first then spend our defense vision will drive our defense budget not the other way around our nation also need a clear strategy to confront the threat of the 21st century threat that be much widespread and little certain they range from terrorist who threaten with bomb to tyrant in rogue nation intent upon develop weapon of mass destruction to protect our own people our ally and friend we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defense and as we transform our military we can discard cold war relic and reduce our own nuclear force to reflect today's need a strong america be the world's good hope for peace and freedom yet the cause of freedom rest on much than our ability to defend ourselves and our ally freedom be export every day as we ship good and product that improve the life of million of people free trade bring great political and personal freedom each of the previous five president have have the ability to negotiate far reach trade agreement tonight i ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority and to do so quickly as we meet tonight many citizen be struggle with the high cost of energy we have a serious energy problem that demand a national energy policy the west be confront a major energy shortage that have result in high price and uncertainty i've ask federal agency to work with california official to help speed construction of new energy source and i have direct vice president cheney commerce secretary evans energy secretary abraham and other senior member in my administration to develop a national energy policy our energy demand outstrip our supply we can produce much energy at home while protect our environment and we must we can produce much electricity to meet demand and we must we can promote alternative energy source and conservation and we must america must become much energy independent and we will perhaps the big test of our foresight and courage will be reform medicare and social security medicare's finance be strain and its coverage be outdate ninety nine percent of employer provide health plan offer some form of prescription drug coverage medicare do not the framework for reform have be develop by senator frist and breaux and congressman thomas and now be the time to act medicare must be modernize and we must make sure that every senior on medicare can choose a health care plan that offer prescription drug seven year from now the baby boom generation will begin to claim social security benefit every one in this chamber know that social security be not prepare to fully fund their retirement and we only have a couple of year to get prepare without reform this country will one day awaken to a stark choice either a drastic rise in payroll tax or a radical cut in retirement benefit there be a good way this spring i will form a presidential commission to reform social security the commission will make its recommendation by next fall reform should be base on this principle it must preserve the benefit of all current retiree and that near retirement it must return social security to sound financial foot and it must offer personal saving account to young worker who want them social security now offer worker a return of little than percent on the money they pay into the system to save the system we must increase that by allow young worker to make safe sound investment that yield a high rate of return ownership access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few they be the hope of every american and we must make them the foundation of social security by confront the tough challenge of reform by be responsible with our budget we can earn the trust of the american people and we can add to that trust by enact fair and balance election and campaign reform the agendum i have set before you tonight be worthy of a great

you the resource you need to fight and win the war on terror i know that some people question if america be really in a war at all they view terrorism much as a crime a problem to be solve mainly with law enforcement and indictment after the world trade center be first attack in some of the guilty be indict and try and convict and send to prison but the matter be not settle the terrorist be still train and plot in other nation and draw up much ambitious plan after the chaos and carnage of september the 11th it be not enough to serve our enemy with legal paper the terrorist and their supporter declare war on the unite state and war be what they get some in this chamber and in our country do not support the liberation of iraq objection to war often come from principled motive but let us be candid about the consequence of leave saddam hussein in power we're seek all the fact already the kay report identify dozen of weapon of mass destruction relate program activity and significant amount of equipment that iraq conceal from the unite nation have we fail to act the dictator's weapon of mass destruction program would continue to this day have we fail to act security council resolution on iraq would have be reveal as empty threat weaken the unite nation and encourage defiance by dictator around the world iraq's torture chamber would still be fill with victim terrify and innocent the kill field of iraq where hundred of thousand of man and woman and child vanish into the sand would still be know only to the killer for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam hussein's regime be a good and safe place some critic have say our duty in iraq must be internationalize this particular criticism be hard to explain to our partner in britain australia japan south korea the philippines thailand italy spain poland denmark hungary bulgaria ukraine romania the netherlands norway el salvador and the other country that have commit troop to iraq as we debate at home we must never ignore the vital contribution of our international partner or dismiss their sacrifice from the begin america have seek international support for our operation in afghanistan and iraq and we have gain much support there be a difference however between lead a coalition of many nation and submit to the objection of a few america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country we also hear doubt that democracy be a realistic goal for the great middle east where freedom be rare yet it be mistake and condescend to assume that whole culture and great religion be incompatible with liberty and self government i believe that god have plant in every human heart the desire to live in freedom and even when that desire be crush by tyranny for decade it will rise again as long as the middle east remain a place of tyranny and despair and anger it will continue to produce man and movement that threaten the safety of america and our friend so america be pursue a forward strategy of freedom in the great middle east we will challenge the enemy of reform confront the ally of terror and expect a high standard from our friend to cut through the barrier of hateful propaganda the voice of america and other broadcast service be expand their program in arabic and persian and soon a new television service will begin provide reliable news and information across the region i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free election and free market free press and free labor

america be a nation with a mission and that mission come from our much basic belief we have no desire to dominate no ambition of empire our aim be a democratic peace a peace found upon the dignity and right of every man and woman america act in this cause with friend and ally at our side yet we understand our special call this great republic will lead the cause of freedom in the last year adversity

much test be the only way to identify and help student who be fall behind this nation will not go back to the day of simply shuffle child along from grade to grade without them learn the basic i refuse to give up on any child and the no child leave behind act be open the door of opportunity to all of america's child at the same time we must ensure that old student and adult can gain the skill

to create job for american worker young worker should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by save part of their social security tax in a personal retirement account we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by act as good steward of taxpayer dollar in week i will send you a budget that fund the war protect the homeland and meet important domestic need while limit the growth in discretionary spend to little than percent this will require that congress focus on priority cut wasteful spend and be wise with the people's money by do so we can cut the deficit in half over the next year tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration law so they reflect our value and benefit our economy i propose a new temporary worker program to match will foreign worker with will employer when no american can be find to fill the job this reform will be good for our economy because employer will find need worker in a honest and orderly system a temporary worker program will help protect our homeland allow border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threat to our national security i oppose amnesty because it would encourage far illegal immigration and unfairly reward that who break our law my temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for that who

senior who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bill cut roughly in half under this reform senior citizen will be able to keep their medicare just as it be or they can choose a medicare plan that fit them good just as you as member of congress can choose a insurance plan that meet your need and start this year million of american will be able to save money tax free for their medical expense in a health saving account i sign this measure proudly and any attempt to limit the choice of our senior or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare will meet my veto on the critical issue of health care our goal be to ensure that american can choose and afford private health care coverage that good fit their individual need to make insurance much affordable congress must act to address rapidly rise health care cost small business should be able to band together and negotiate for low insurance rate so they can cover much worker with health insurance i urge you to pass association health plan i ask you to give low income american a refundable tax credit that would allow million to buy their own basic health insurance by computerize health record we can avoid dangerous medical mistake reduce cost and improve care to protect the doctor patient relationship and keep good doctor do good work we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuit

health care system be the wrong prescription by keep cost under control expand access and help much american afford coverage we will preserve the system of private medicine that make america's health care the good in the world we be live in a time of great change in our world in our economy in science and medicine yet some thing endure courage and compassion reverence and integrity respect for difference of faith and race the value we try to live by never change and they be instill in us by fundamental institution such as family and school and religious congregation this institution this unseen pillar of civilization must remain strong in america and we will defend them we must stand with our family to help them raise healthy responsible child when it come to help child make right choice there be work for all of us to do one of the bad decision our child can make be to gamble their life and future on drug our government be help parent confront this problem with aggressive education treatment and law enforcement drug use in high school have decline by percent over the last year four hundred thousand few young people be use illegal drug than in the year in my budget i propose new fund to continue our aggressive community base strategy to reduce demand for illegal drug drug test in our school have prove to be a effective part of this effort so tonight i propose a additional million for school that want to use drug test as a tool to save children's life the aim here be not to punish child but to send them this message we love you and we do not want to lose you to help child make right choice they need good example athletic play such a important role in our society but unfortunately some in professional sport be not set much of a example the use of performance enhance drug like steroid in baseball football and other sport be dangerous and it send the wrong message that there be shortcut to accomplishment and that performance be much important than character so tonight i call on team owner union representative coach and player to take the lead to send the right signal to get tough and to get rid of steroid now to encourage right choice we

pass the defense of marriage act sign in by president clinton that statute protect marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman and declare that one state may not redefine marriage for other state activist judge however have begin redefine marriage by court order without regard for the will of the people and their elect representative on a issue of such great consequence the people's voice must be hear if judge insist on force their arbitrary will upon the people the only alternative leave to the people would be the constitutional process our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage the outcome of this debate be important and so be the way we conduct it the same moral tradition that define marriage also teach that each individual have dignity and value in god's sight it's also important to strengthen our community by unleash the compassion of america's religious institution religious charity of every creed be do some of the much vital work in our country mentor child feed the hungry take the hand of the lonely yet government have often deny social service grant and contract to this group just because they have a cross or a star of david or a crescent on the wall by executive order i have open billion of dollar in grant money to competition that include faith base charity tonight i ask you to codify this into law so people of faith can

effort or do not fulfill essential priority the principle here be clear a taxpayer dollar must be spend wisely or not at all to make our economy strong and much dynamic we must prepare a rise generation to fill the job of the 21st century under the no child leave behind act standard be high test score be on the rise and we be close the achievement gap for minority student now we must demand good result from our high school so every high school diploma be a ticket to success we will help a additional worker to get train for a good career by reform our job train system and strengthen america's community college and we will make it easy for american to afford a college education by increase the size of pell grant to make our economy strong and much competitive america must reward not punish the effort and dream of entrepreneur small business be the path of advancement especially for woman and minority so we must free small business from needless regulation and protect honest job creator from junk lawsuit justice be distort and our economy be hold back by irresponsible class action and frivolous asbestos claim and i urge congress to pass legal reform this year to make our economy strong and much productive we must make health care much affordable and give family great access to good coverage and much control over their health decision i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agendum with tax credit to help low income worker buy insurance a community health center in every poor county improve information technology to prevent medical error and needless cost association health plan for small business and their employee expand health saving account and medical liability reform that will reduce health care cost and make sure patient have the doctor and care they need to keep our economy grow we also need reliable supply of affordable environmentally responsible energy nearly four year ago i submit a comprehensive energy strategy that encourage conservation alternative source a modernize electricity grid and much production here at home include safe clean nuclear energy my clear sky legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizen and my budget provide strong fund for lead edge technology from hydrogen fuel car to clean coal to renewable source such as ethanol four year of debate be enough i urge congress to pass legislation that make america much secure and little dependent on foreign energy all this proposal be essential to expand this economy and add new job but they be just the begin of our duty to build the prosperity of future generation we must update institution that be create to meet the need of a early time year after year american be burden by a archaic incoherent federal tax code i have appoint a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when their recommendation be deliver you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that be pro growth easy to understand and fair to all america's immigration system be also outdate unsuited to the need of our economy and to the value of our country we should not be content with law that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their family and deny business will worker and invite chaos at our border it be time for a immigration policy that permit temporary guest worker to fill job american will not take that reject amnesty that tell us who be enter and leave our country and that close the border to drug dealer and terrorist one of america's much important institution a symbol of the trust between generation be also in need of wise and effective reform social security be a great moral success of the 20th century and we must honor its great purpose in this new century the system however on its current path be head toward bankruptcy and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security today much than million american receive social security benefit and million much be near retirement and for them the system be strong and fiscally sound i have a message for every american who be or old do not let anyone mislead you for you the social security system will not change in any way for young worker the social security system have serious problem that will grow bad with time social security be create decade ago for a very different era in that day people didn't live as long benefit be much low than they be today and a half century ago about worker pay into the system for each person draw benefit our society have change in way the founder of social security can not have foresee in today's world people be live long and therefore draw benefit long and that benefit be schedule to rise dramatically over the next few decade and instead of worker pay in for every beneficiary right now it's only about three worker and over the next few decade that numb will fall to just two worker per beneficiary with each pass year few worker be pay ever high benefit to a ever large numb of retiree so here be the result thirteen year from now in social security will be pay out much than it take in and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall big than the year before for example in the year the government will somehow have to come up with a extra billion dollar to keep the system afloat and by the annual shortfall would be much than billion dollar by the year the entire system would be exhaust and bankrupt if step be not take to avert that outcome the only solution would be drastically high tax massive new borrow or sudden and severe cut in social security benefit or other government program i recognize that and may seem like a long way off but that date be not so distant as any parent will tell you if you have a five year old you're already concern about how you'll pay for college tuition year down the road if you've get child in their 20s as some of us do the idea of social security collapse before they retire do not seem like a small matter and it should not be a small matter to the unite state congress you and i share a responsibility we must pass reform that solve the financial problem of social security once and for all fix social security permanently will require a open candid review of the option some have suggest limit benefit for wealthy retiree former congressman tim penny have raise the possibility of index benefit to price rather than wage during the 1990s my predecessor president clinton speak of increase the retirement age former senator john breaux suggest discourage early collection of social security benefit the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommend change the way benefit be calculate all this idea be on the table i know that none of this reform would be easy but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty because our children's retirement security be much important than partisan politic i will work with member of congress to find the much effective combination of reform i will listen to anyone who have a good idea to offer we must however be guide by some basic principle we must make social security permanently sound not leave that task for another day we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increase payroll tax we must ensure that low income american get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement we must guarantee that there be no change for that now retire or near retirement and we must take care that any change in the system be gradual so young worker have year to prepare and plan for their future as we fix social security we also have the responsibility to make the system a good deal for young worker and the good way to reach that goal be through voluntary personal retirement account here be how the idea work right now a set portion of the money you earn be take out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefit of today's retiree if you be a young worker i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account so you can build a nest egg for your own future here be why personal account be a good deal your money will grow over time at a great rate than anything the current system can deliver and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security in addition you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulate in your personal account if you wish to your child or grandchild and good of all the money in the account be yours and the government can never take it away the goal here be great security in retirement so we will set careful guideline for personal account we will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bond and stock fund we will make sure that your earnings be not eat up by hide wall street fee we will make sure there be good option to protect your investment from sudden market swing on the eve of your retirement we will make sure a personal account can't be empty out all at once but rather pay out over time as a addition to traditional social security benefit and we will make sure this plan be fiscally responsible by start personal retirement account gradually and raise the yearly limit on contribution over time eventually permit all worker to set aside four percentage point of their payroll tax in their account personal retirement account should be familiar to federal employee because you already have something similar call the thrift saving plan which let worker deposit a portion of their paycheck into any of five different broadly base investment fund it be time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young american our 2 great responsibility to our child and grandchild be to honor and to pass along the value that sustain a free society so many of my generation after a long journey have come home to family and faith and be determine to bring up responsible moral child government be not the source of this value but government should never undermine them because marriage be a sacred institution and the foundation of society it should not be re define by activist judge for the good of family child and society i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage because a society be measure by how it treat the weak and vulnerable we must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help us reach that goal by develop treatment and cure that save life and help people overcome disability and i thank congress for double the fund of the national institute of health to build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advance always serve human dignity not take

for body part and that human life be never buy and sell as a commodity america will continue to lead the world in medical research that be ambitious aggressive and always ethical because court must always deliver impartial justice judge have a duty to faithfully interpret the law not legislate from the bench as president i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate man and woman who understand the role of court in our democracy and be good qualify to serve on the bench and i have do so the constitution also give the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserve a up or down vote because one of the deep value of our country be compassion we must never turn away from any citizen who feel isolate from the opportunity of america our government will continue to support

both the future and the character of our country we will choose to act confidently in pursue the enemy of freedom or retreat from our duty in the hope of a easy life we will choose to build our prosperity by lead the world economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity in a complex and challenge time the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and invite yet it end in danger and decline the only way to protect our people the only way to secure the peace the only way to control our destiny be by our leadership so the unite state of america will continue to lead abroad our nation be commit to a historic long term goal we seek the end of tyranny in our world some dismiss that goal as misguide idealism in reality the future security of america depend on it on september the 11th we find that problem originate in a fail and oppressive state mile away can bring murder and destruction to our country dictatorship shelter terrorist and fee resentment and radicalism and seek weapon of mass destruction democracy replace resentment with hope respect the right of their citizen and their neighbor and join the fight against terror every step toward freedom in the world make our country safe so we will act boldly in freedom's cause far from be a hopeless dream the advance of freedom be the great story of our time in there be about two dozen lonely democracy in the world today there be and we're write a new chapter in the story of self government with woman line up to vote in afghanistan and million of iraqi mark their liberty with purple ink and man and woman from lebanon to egypt debate the right of individual and the necessity of freedom at the start of much than half the people of our world live in democratic nation and we do not forget the other half in place like syria and burma zimbabwe north korea and iran because the demand of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as good no one can deny the success of freedom but some man rage and fight against it and one of the main source of reaction and opposition be radical islam the perversion by a few of a noble faith into a ideology of terror and death terrorist like bin lade be serious about mass murder and all of us must take their declare intention seriously they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east and arm themselves with weapon of mass murder their aim be to seize power in iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attack against america and the world lack the military strength to challenge us directly the terrorist have choose the weapon of fear when they murder child at a school in beslan or blow up commuter in london or behead a bind captive the terrorist hope this horror will break our will allow the violent to inherit the earth but they have miscalculate we love our freedom and we will fight to keep it in a time of test we cannot find security by abandon our commitment and retreat within our border if we be to leave this vicious attacker alone they would not leave us alone they would simply move the battlefield to our own shore there be no peace in retreat and there be no honor in retreat by allow radical islam to work its will by leave a assault world to fend for itself we would signal to all that we no long believe in our own ideal or even in our own courage but our enemy and our friend can be certain the unite state will not retreat from the world and we will never surrender to evil america reject the false comfort of isolationism we be the nation that save liberty in europe and liberate death camp and help raise up democracy and face down a evil empire once again we accept the call of history to deliver the oppress and move this world toward peace we remain on the offensive against terror network we have kill or capture many of their leader and for the other their day will come we remain on the offensive in afghanistan where a fine president and a national assembly be fight terror while build the institution of a new democracy we're on the offensive in iraq with a clear plan for victory first we're help iraqi build a inclusive government so that old resentment will be ease and the insurgency will be marginalize 2 we're continue reconstruction effort and help the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy so all iraqi can experience the benefit of freedom and 3 we're strike terrorist target while we train iraqi force that be increasingly capable of defeat the enemy iraqi be show their courage every day and we be proud to be their ally in the cause of freedom our work in iraq be difficult because our enemy be brutal but that brutality have not stop the dramatic progress of a new democracy in little than year the nation have go from dictatorship to liberation to sovereignty to a constitution to national election at the same time our coalition have be relentless in shut off terrorist infiltration clear out insurgent stronghold and turn over territory to iraqi security force i be confident in our plan for victory i be confident in the will of the iraqi people i be confident in the skill and spirit of our military fellow citizen we be in this fight to win and we be win the road of victory be the road that will take our troop home as we make progress on the grind and iraqi force increasingly take the lead we should be able to far decrease our troop level but that decision will be make by our military commander not by politician in washington dc our coalition have learn from our experience in iraq we've adjust our military tactic and change our approach to reconstruction along the way we have benefit from responsible criticism and counsel offer by member of congress of both party in the come year i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice yet there be a difference between responsible criticism that aim for success and defeatism that refuse to acknowledge anything but failure hindsight alone be not wisdom and 2 guess be not a strategy with so much in the balance that of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor a sudden withdrawal of our force from iraq would abandon our iraqi ally to death and prison would put man like bin lade and zarqawi in charge of a strategic country and show that a pledge from america mean little member of congress however we feel about the decision and debate of the past our nation have only one option we must keep our word defeat our enemy and stand behind the american military in this vital mission our man and woman in uniform be make sacrifice and show a sense of duty strong than all fear they know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of street to wear heavy gear in the desert heat to see a comrade kill by a roadside bomb and that who know the cost also know the stake marine staff sergeant dan clay be kill last month fight in fallujah he leave behind a letter to his family but his word can just as good be address to every american here be what dan write i know what honor be it have be a honor to protect and serve all of you i face death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to never falter don't hesitate to honor and support that of us who have the honor of protect that which be worth protect staff sergeant dan clay's wife lisa and his mom and dad sara jo and bud be with us this even welcome our nation be grateful to the fall who live in the memory of our country we're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform and as we honor our brave troop let us never forget the sacrifice of america's military family our offensive against terror involve much than military action ultimately the only way to defeat the terrorist be to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offer the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change so the unite state of america support democratic reform across the broad middle east election be vital but they be only the begin raise up a democracy require the rule of law and protection of minority and strong accountable institution that last long than a single vote the great people of egypt have vote in a multiparty presidential election and now their government should open path of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism the palestinian people have vote in election and now the leader of hamas must recognize israel disarm reject terrorism and work for last peace saudi arabia have take the first step of reform now it can offer its people a good future by press forward with that effort democracy in the middle east will not look like our own because they will reflect the tradition of their own citizen yet liberty be the future of every nation in the middle east because liberty be the right and hope of all humanity the same be true of iran a nation now hold hostage by a small clerical elite that be isolate and repress its people the regime in that country sponsor terrorist in the palestinian territory and in lebanon and that must come to a end the iranian government be defy the world with its nuclear ambition and the nation of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapon america will continue to rally the world to confront this threat tonight let me speak directly to the citizen of iran america respect you and we respect your country we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom and our nation hope one day to be the close of friend with a free and democratic iran to overcome danger in our world we must also take the offensive by encourage economic progress and fight disease and spread hope in hopeless land isolationism would not only tie our hand in fight enemy it would keep us from help our friend in desperate need we show compassion abroad because american believe in the god give dignity and worth of a villager with hiv aid or a infant with malaria or a refugee flee genocide or a young girl sell into slavery we also show compassion abroad because region overwhelm by poverty corruption and despair be source of terrorism and organize crime and human traffic and the drug trade in recent year you and i have take unprecedented action to fight aid and malaria expand the education of girl and reward develop nation that be move forward with economic and political reform for people everywhere the unite state be a partner for a good life shortchange this effort would increase the suffer and chaos of our world undercut our long term security and dull the conscience of our country i urge member of congress to serve the interest of america by show the compassion of america our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home the enemy have not lose the desire or capability to attack us fortunately this nation have superb professional in law enforcement intelligence the military and homeland security this man and woman be dedicate their life protect us all and they deserve our support and our thank they also deserve the same tool they already use to fight drug traffic and organize crime so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act it be say that

speaker vice president cheney member of congress distinguish guest and fellow citizen the rite of custom bring us together at a define hour when decision be hard and courage be need we enter the year with large endeavor underway and other that be ours to begin in all of this much be ask of us we must have the will to face difficult challenge and determine enemy and the wisdom to face them together some in this chamber be new to the house and the senate and i congratulate the democrat majority congress have change but not our responsibility each of us be guide by our own conviction and to this we must stay faithful yet we're all hold to the same standard and call to serve the same good purpose to extend this nation's prosperity to spend the people's money wisely to solve problem not leave them to future generation to guard america against all evil and to keep faith with that we have send forth to defend us we're not the first to come here with a government divide and uncertainty in the air like many before us we can work through our difference and we can achieve big thing for the american people our citizen don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on as long as we're will to cross that aisle when there be work to be do our job be to make life good for our fellow american and to help them build a future of hope and opportunity and this be the business before us tonight a future of hope and opportunity begin with a grow economy and that be what we have we're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth a recovery that have create million new job so far unemployment be low inflation be low wage be rise this economy be on the move and our job be to keep it that way not with much government but with much enterprise next week i'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy tonight i want to discuss three economic reform that deserve to be priority for this congress first we must balance the federal budget we can do so without raise tax what we need be spend discipline in washington dc we set a goal of cut the deficit in half by and meet that goal year ahead of schedule now let us take the next step in the come week i will submit a budget that eliminate the federal deficit within the next year i ask you to make the same commitment together we can restrain the spend appetite of the federal government and we can balance the federal budget next there be the matter of earmark this special interest item be often slip into bill at the last hour when not even c spin be watch in alone the numb of earmark grow to over and total nearly billion even bad over percent of the earmark never make it to the floor of the house and senate they be drop into committee report that be not even part of the bill that arrive on my desk you didn't vote them into law i didn't sign them into law yet they're treat as if they have the force of law the time have come to end this practice so let us work together to reform the budget process expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress and cut the numb and cost of earmark at less in half by the end of this session and finally to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlement social security and medicare and medicaid be commitment of conscience and so it be our duty to keep them permanently sound yet we're fail in that duty and this failure will one day leave our child with three bad option huge tax increase huge deficit or huge and immediate cut in benefit everyone in this chamber know this to be true yet somehow we have not find it in ourselves to act so let us work together and do it now with enough good sense and good will you and i can fix medicare and medicaid and save social security spread opportunity and hope in america also require public school that give child the knowledge and character they need in life five year ago we rise above partisan difference to pass the no child leave behind act preserve local control raise standard and hold school accountable for result and because we act student be perform good in read and math and minority student be close the achievement gap now the task be to build on the success without water down standard without take control from local community and without backslide and call it reform we can lift student achievement even high by give local leader flexibility to turn around fail school and by give family with child stick in fail school the right to choose someplace good we must increase fund for student who struggle and make sure this child get the special help they need and we can make sure our child be prepare for the job of the future and our country be much competitive by strengthen math and science skill the no child leave behind act have work for america's child and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law a future of hope and opportunity require that all our citizen have affordable and available health care when it come to health care government have a obligation to care for the elderly the disable and poor child and we will meet that responsibility for all other american private health insurance be the good way to meet their need but many american cannot afford a health insurance policy and so tonight i propose two new initiative to help much american afford their own insurance first i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependent family with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax or payroll tax on of their income single american with health insurance will pay no income or payroll tax on of their income with this reform much than million man woman and child who be now cover by employer provide insurance will benefit from low tax bill at the same time this reform will level the play field for that who do not get health insurance through their job for american who now purchase health insurance on their own this proposal would mean a substantial tax saving for a family of four make a year and for the million of other american who have no health insurance at all this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach change the tax code be a vital and necessary step to make health care affordable for much american my 2 proposal be to help the state that be come up with innovative way to cover the uninsured state that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizen should receive federal fund to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick i have ask the secretary of health and human service to work with congress to take exist federal fund and use them to create affordable choice grant this grant would give our nation's governor much money and much flexibility to get private health insurance to that much in need there be many other way that congress can help we need to expand health saving account we need to help small business through association health plan we need to reduce cost and medical error with good information technology we will encourage price transparency and to protect good doctor from junk lawsuit we need to pass medical liability reform in all we do we must remember that the good health care decision be not make by government and insurance company but by patient and their doctor extend hope and opportunity in our country require a immigration system worthy of america with law that be fair and border that be secure when law and border be routinely violate this harm the interest of our country to secure our border we're double the size of the border patrol and fund new infrastructure and technology yet even with all this step we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border and that require a temporary worker program we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign worker to enter our country to work on a temporary basis as a result they won't have to try to sneak in and that will leave border agent free to chase down drug smuggler and criminal and terrorist we'll enforce our immigration law at the worksite and give employer the tool to verify the legal status of their worker so there's no excuse leave for violate the law we need to uphold the great tradition of the melt pot that welcome and assimilate new arrival we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrant who be already in our country without animosity and without amnesty conviction run deep in this capitol when it come to immigration let us have a serious civil and conclusive debate so that you can pass and i can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law extend hope and opportunity depend on a stable supply of energy that keep america's economy run and america's environment clean for too long our nation have be dependent on foreign oil and this dependence leave us much vulnerable to hostile regime and to terrorist who can cause huge disruption of oil shipment and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy it's in our vital interest to diversify america's energy supply the way forward be through technology we must continue change the way america generate electric power by even great use of clean coal technology solar and wind energy and clean safe nuclear power we need to press on with battery research for plug in and hybrid vehicle and expand the use of clean diesel vehicle and biodiesel fuel we must continue invest in new method of produce ethanol use everything from wood chip to grass to agricultural waste we make a lot of progress thank to good policy here in washington and the strong response of the market and now even much dramatic advance be within reach tonight i ask congress to join me in pursue a great goal let us build on the work we've do and reduce gasoline usage in the unite state by percent in the next year when we do that we will have cut our total import by the equivalent of three quarter of all the oil we now import from the middle east to reach this goal we must increase the supply of alternative fuel by set a mandatory fuel standard to require billion gallon of renewable and alternative fuel in and that be nearly five time the current target at the same time we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standard for car the way we do for light truck and conserve up to billion much gallon of gasoline by achieve this ambitious goal will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil but it's not go to eliminate it and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive way and to far protect america against severe disruption to our oil supply i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve america be on the verge of technological breakthrough that will enable us to live our life little dependent on oil and this technology will help us be good steward of the environment and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change a future of hope and opportunity require a fair impartial system of justice the life of our citizen across our nation be affect by the outcome of case pend in our federal court we have a share obligation to ensure that the federal court have enough judge to hear that case and deliver timely ruling as president i have a duty to nominate qualify man and woman to vacancy on the federal bench and the unite state senate have a duty as good to give that nominee a fair hear and a prompt up or down vote on the senate floor for all of us in this room there be no high responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger five year have come and go since we see the scene and feel the sorrow that the terrorist can cause we've have time to take stock of our situation we've add many critical protection to guard the homeland we know with certainty that the horror of that september morning be just a glimpse of what the terrorist intend for us unless we stop them with the distance of time we find ourselves debate the cause of conflict and the course we have follow such debate be essential when a great democracy face great question yet one question have surely be settle that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy from the start america and our ally have protect our people by stay on the offense the enemy know that the day of comfortable sanctuary easy movement steady finance and free flow communication be long over for the terrorist life since have never be the same our success in this war be often measure by the thing that do not happen we cannot know the full extent of the attack that we and our ally have prevent but here be some of what we do know we stop a al qaida plot to fly a hijack airplane into the tall build on the west coast we break up a southeast asian terror cell groom operative for attack inside the unite state we uncover a al qaida cell develop anthrax to be use in attack against america and just last august british authority uncover a plot to blow up passenger plane bind for america over the atlantic ocean for each life save we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servant who devote their life to find the terrorist and stop them every success against the terrorist be a reminder of the shoreless ambition of this enemy the evil that inspire and rejoice in be still at work in the world and so long as that's the case america be still a nation at war in the mind of the terrorist this war begin good before september the 11th and will not end until their radical vision be fulfill and this past year have give us a much clear view of the nature of this enemy al qaida and its follower be sunni extremist possess by hatred and command by a harsh and narrow ideology take almost any principle of civilization and their goal be the opposite they preach with threat instruct with bullet and bomb and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent our enemy be quite explicit about their intention they want to overthrow moderate government and establish safe haven from which to plan and carry out new attack on our country by kill and terrorize american they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology listen to this warn from the late terrorist zarqawi we will sacrifice our blood and body to put a end to your dream and what be come be even bad usama bin lade declare death be good than live on this earth with the unbeliever among us this man be not give to idle word and they be just one camp in the islamist radical movement in recent time it have also become clear that we face a escalate danger from shi'a extremist who be just as hostile to america and be also determine to dominate the middle east many be know to take direction from the regime in iran which be fund and arm terrorist like hizballah a group 2 only to al qaida in the american life it have take the shi'a and sunni extremist be different face of the same totalitarian threat whatever slogan they chant when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purpose they want to kill american kill democracy in the middle east and gain the weapon to kill on a even much horrific scale in the 6 year since our nation be attack i wish i can report to you that the danger have end they have not and so it remain the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence diplomacy law enforcement and military action to do our duty to find this enemy and to protect the american people this war be much than a clash of arm it be a decisive ideological struggle and the security of our nation be in the balance to prevail we must remove the condition that inspire blind hatred and drive man to get onto airplane and to come and kill us what every terrorist fear much be human freedom society where man and woman make their own choice answer to their own conscience and live by their hope instead of their resentment free people be not draw to violent and malignant ideology and much will choose a good way when they're give a chance so we advance our own security interest by help moderate and reformer and brave voice for democracy the great question of our day be whether america will help man and woman in the middle east to build free society and share in the right of all humanity and i say for the sake of our own security we must in the last year we've see the desire for liberty in the broad middle east and we have be sober by the enemy's fierce reaction in the world watch as the citizen of lebanon raise the banner of the cedar revolution they drive out the syrian occupier and choose new leader in free election in the people of afghanistan defy the terrorist and elect a democratic legislature and in the iraqi people hold three national election choose a transitional government adopt the much progressive democratic constitution in the arab world and then elect a government under that constitution despite endless threat from the killer in their midst nearly million iraqi citizen come out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget a think enemy watch all of this scene adjust their tactic and in they strike back in lebanon assassin take the life of pierre gemayel a prominent participant in the cedar revolution hizballah terrorist with support from syria and iran sow conflict in the region and be seek to undermine lebanon's legitimately elect government in afghanistan taliban and al qaida fighter try to regain power by regroup and engage afghan and nato force in iraq al qaida and other sunni extremist blow up one of the much sacred place in shi'a islam the golden mosque of samarra this atrocity direct at a muslim house of prayer be design to provoke retaliation from iraqi shi'a and it succeed radical shi'a element some of whom receive support from iran form death squad the result be a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continue to this day this be not the fight we enter in iraq but it be the fight we're in every one of us wish this war be over and win yet it would not be like us to leave our promise unkept our friend abandon and our own security at risk lady and gentleman on this day at this hour it be still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle let us find our resolve and turn event toward victory we're carry out a new strategy in iraq a plan that demand much from iraq's elect government and give our force in iraq the reinforcement they need to complete their mission our goal be a democratic iraq that uphold the rule of law respect the right of its people provide them security and be a ally in the war on terror in order to make progress toward this goal the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital but the iraqi be not yet ready to do this on their own so we're deploy reinforcement of much than additional soldier and marine to iraq the vast majority will go to baghdad where they will help iraqi force to clear and secure neighborhood and serve as adviser embed in iraqi army unit with iraqi in the lead our force will help secure the city by chase down the terrorist insurgent and the roam death squad and in anbar province where al qaida terrorist have gather and local force have begin show a willingness to fight them we're send a additional unite state marine with order to find the terrorist and clear them out we didn't drive al qaida out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free iraq the people of iraq want to live in peace and now it's time for their government to act iraq's leader know that our commitment be not open end they have promise to deploy much of their own troop to secure baghdad and they must do so they pledge that they will confront violent radical of any faction or political party and they need to follow through and lift needless restriction on iraqi and coalition force so this troop can achieve their mission of bring security to all of the people of baghdad iraq's leader have commit themselves to a series of benchmark to achieve reconciliation to share oil revenue among all of iraq's citizen to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuild of iraq to allow much iraqi to reenter their nation's civic life to hold local election and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province but for all of this to happen baghdad must be secure and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitment my fellow citizen our military commander and i have carefully weigh the option we discuss every possible approach in the end i choose this course of action because it provide the good chance for success many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq because you understand that the consequence of failure would be grievous and far reach if american force step back before baghdad be secure the iraqi government would be overrun by extremist on all side we can expect a epic battle between shi'a extremist back by iran and sunni extremist aid by al qaida and supporter of the old regime a contagion of violence can spill out across the country and in time the entire region can be draw into the conflict for america this be a nightmare scenario for the enemy this be the objective chaos be the great ally their great ally in this struggle and out of chaos in iraq would emerge a embolden enemy with new safe haven new recruit new resource and a even great determination to harm america to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lesson of september the 11th and invite tragedy lady and gentleman nothing be much important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger this be where matter stand tonight in the here and now i have speak with many of you in person i respect you and the argument you've make we go into this largely unite in our assumption and in our conviction and whatever you vote for you do not vote for failure our country be pursue a new strategy in iraq and i ask you to give it a chance to work and i ask you to support our troop in the field and that on their way the war on terror we fight today be a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turn our duty over to other and that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through both party and both branch should work in close consultation it's why i've propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror make up of leader in congress from both political party we will share idea for how to position america to meet every challenge that confront us we'll show our enemy abroad that we be unite in the goal of victory and one of the first step we can take together be to add to the rank of our military so that the american arm force be ready for all the challenge ahead tonight i ask the congress to authorize a increase in the size of our active army and marine corp by in the next year a 2 task we can take on together be to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corp such a corp would function much like our military reserve it would ease the burden on the arm force by allow us to hire civilian with critical skill to serve on mission abroad when america need them it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the define struggle of our time american can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone we have a diplomatic strategy that be rally the world to join in the fight against extremism in iraq multinational force be operate under a mandate from the unite nation we're work with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the

freedom in place like cuba belarus and burma and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur american foreign policy be much than a matter of war and diplomacy our work

of the unite state she's around here somewhere i have come here tonight not only to address the distinguish man and woman in this great chamber but to speak frankly and directly to the man and woman who send us here i know that for many american watch right now the state of our economy be a concern that rise above all other and rightly so if you haven't be personally affect by this recession you probably know someone who have a friend a neighbor a member of your family you don't need to hear another list of statistic to know that our economy be in crisis because you live it every day it's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless night it's the job you think you'd retire from but now have lose the business you build your dream upon that's now hang by a thread the college acceptance letter your child have to put back in the envelope the impact of this recession be real and it be everywhere but while our economy may be weaken and our confidence shake though we be live through difficult and uncertain time tonight i want every american to know this we will rebuild we will recover and the unite state of america will emerge strong than before the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation the answer to our problem don't lie beyond our reach they exist in our laboratory and our university in our field and our factory in the imagination of our entrepreneur and the pride of the hard work people on earth that quality that have make america the great force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure what be require now be for this country to pull together confront boldly the challenge we face and take responsibility for our future once much now if we're honest with ourselves we'll admit that for too long we have not always meet this responsibility as a government or as a people i say this not to lie blame or to look backwards but because it be only by understand how we arrive at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament the fact be our economy do not fall into decline overnight nor do all of our problem begin when the house market collapse or the stock market sink we have know for decade that our survival depend on find new source of energy yet we import much oil today than ever before the cost of health care eat up much and much of our saving each year yet we keep delay reform our child will compete for job in a global economy that too many of our school do not prepare them for and though all this challenge go unsolved we still manage to spend much money and pile up much debt both as individual and through our government than ever before in other word we have live through a era where too often short term gain be prize over long term prosperity where we fail to look beyond the next payment the next quarter or the next election a surplus become a excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of a opportunity to invest in our future regulation be gut for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market people buy home they know they couldn't afford from bank and lender who push that bad loan anyway and all the while critical debate and difficult decision be put off for some other time on some other day good that day of reckon have arrive and the time to take charge of our future be here now be the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy but to build a new foundation for last prosperity now be the time to jumpstart job creation restart lend and invest in area like energy health care and education that will grow our economy even as we make hard choice to bring our deficit down that be what my economic agendum be design to do and that be what i'd like to talk to you about tonight it's a agendum that begin with job as soon as i take office i ask this congress to send me a recovery plan by president's day that would put people back to work and put money in their pocket not because i believe in big government i don't not because i'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherit i be i call for action because the failure to do so would have cost much job and cause much hardship in fact a failure to act would have worsen our long term deficit by assure weak economic growth for year and that's why i push for quick action and tonight i be grateful that this congress deliver and please to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act be now law over the next year this plan will save or create million job much than percent of this job will be in the private sector job rebuild our road and bridge construct wind turbine and solar panel lay broadband and expand mass transit because of this plan there be teacher who can now keep their job and educate our kid health care professional can continue care for our sick there be police officer who be still on the street of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevent the layoff their department be about to make because of this plan percent of work household in america will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paycheck begin on april 1st because of this plan family who be struggle to pay tuition cost will receive a tax credit for all year of college and american who have lose their job in this recession will be able to receive extend unemployment benefit and continue health care coverage to help them weather this storm now i know there be some in this chamber and watch at home who be skeptical of whether this plan will work and i understand that skepticism here in washington we've all see how quickly good intention can turn into break promise and wasteful spend and with a plan of this scale come enormous responsibility to get it right and that's why i've ask vice president biden to lead a tough unprecedented oversight effort because nobody mess with joe i be i right they don't mess with him i have tell each of my cabinet as good as mayor and governor across the country that they will be hold accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend i've appoint a prove and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all case of waste and fraud and we have create a new web site call recovery.gov so that every american can find out how and where their money be be spend so the recovery plan we pass be the first step in get our economy back on track but it be just the first step because even if we manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that have severely weaken our financial system i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight because every american should know that it directly affect you and your family's good be you should also know that the money you've deposit in bank across the country be safe your insurance be secure you can rely on the continue operation of our financial system that's not the source of concern the concern be that if we do not restart lend in this country our recovery will be choke off before it even begin you see the flow of credit be the lifeblood of our economy the ability to get a loan be how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education how store stock their shelf farm buy equipment and business make payroll but credit have stop flow the way it should too many bad loan from the house crisis have make their way onto the book of too many bank and with so much debt and so little confidence this bank be now fearful of lend out any much money to household to business or even to each other and when there be no lend family can't afford to buy home or car so business be force to make layoff our economy suffer even much and credit dry up even far that be why this administration be move swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle to restore confidence and restart lend and we will do so in several way first we be create a new lend fund that represent the large effort ever to help provide auto loan college loan and small business loan to the consumer and entrepreneur who keep this economy run 2 we have launch a house plan that will help responsible family face the threat of foreclosure low their monthly payment and refinance their mortgage it's a plan that won't help speculator or that neighbor down the street who buy a house he can never hope to afford but it will help million of american who be struggle with decline home value american who will now be able to take advantage of the low interest rate that this plan have already help to bring about in fact the average family who refinance today can save nearly per year on their mortgage 3 we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major bank that american depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in much difficult time and when we learn that a major bank have serious problem we will hold accountable that responsible force the necessary adjustment provide the support to clean up their balance sheet and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people and our economy now i understand that on any give day wall street may be much comfort by a approach that give bank bailout with no string attach and that hold nobody accountable for their reckless decision but such a approach won't solve the problem and our goal be to quicken the day when we restart lend to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all and i intend to hold this bank fully accountable for the assistance they receive and this time they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollar result in much lend for the american taxpayer this time ceos won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paycheck or buy fancy drape or disappear on a private jet that day be over still this plan will require significant resource from the federal government and yes probably much than we've already set aside but while the cost of action will be great i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far great for it can result in a economy that sputter along for not month or year but perhaps a decade that would be bad for our deficit bad for business bad for you and bad for the next generation and i refuse to let that happen now i understand that when the last administration ask this congress to provide assistance for struggle bank democrat and republican alike be infuriate by the mismanagement and the result that follow so be the american taxpayer so be i so i know how unpopular it be to be see as help bank right now especially when everyone be suffer in part from their bad decision i promise you i get it but i also know that in a time of crisis we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politic of the moment my job our job be to solve the problem our job be to govern with a sense of responsibility i will not send i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of reward a single wall street executive but i will do whatever it take to help the small business that can't pay its worker or the family that have save and still can't get a mortgage that's what this be about it's not about help bank it's about help people it's not about help bank it's about help people because when credit be available again that young family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire worker to build it and then that worker will have money to spend and if they can get a loan too maybe they'll finally buy that car or open their own business investor will return to the market and american family will see their retirement secure once much slowly but surely confidence will return and our economy will recover so i ask this congress to join me in do whatever prove necessary because we cannot consign our nation to a open end recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happen again i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdate regulatory system it be time to put in place tough new commonsense rule of the road so that our financial market reward drive and innovation and punish shortcut and abuse the recovery plan and the financial stability plan be the immediate step we're take to revive our economy in the short term but the only way to fully restore america's economic strength be to make the long term investment that will lead to new job new industry and a renew ability to compete with the rest of the world the only way this century will be another american century be if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care the school that aren't prepare our child and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit that be our responsibility in the next few day i will submit a budget to congress so often we've come to view this document as simply number on a page or a laundry list of program i see this document differently i see it as a vision for america as a blueprint for our future my budget do not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue it reflect the stark reality of what we've inherit a trillion dollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession give this reality everyone in this chamber democrat and republican will have to sacrifice some worthy priority for which there be no dollar and that include me but that do not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenge i reject the view that say our problem will simply take care of themselves that say government have no role in lay the foundation for our common prosperity for history tell a different story history remind us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation this nation have respond with bold action and big idea in the midst of civil war we lay railroad track from one coast to another that spur commerce and industry from the turmoil of the industrial revolution come a system of public high school that prepare our citizen for a new age in the wake of war and depression the gi bill send a generation to college and create the large middle class in history and a twilight struggle for freedom lead to a nation of highway a american on the moon and a explosion of technology that still shape our world in each case government didn't supplant private enterprise it catalyze private enterprise it create the condition for thousand of entrepreneur and new business to adapt and to thrive we be a nation that have see promise amid peril and claim opportunity from ordeal now we must be that nation again and that be why even as it cut back on program we don't need the budget i submit will invest in the three area that be absolutely critical to our economic future energy health care and education it begin with energy we know the country that harness the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st century and yet it be china that have launch the large effort in history to make their economy energy efficient we invent solar technology but we've fall behind country like germany and japan in produce it new plug in hybrid roll off our assembly line but they will run on battery make in korea good i do not accept a future where the job and industry of tomorrow take root beyond our border and i know you don't either it be time for america to lead again thank to our recovery plan we will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next year we've also make the large investment in basic research fund in american history a investment that will spur not only new discovery in energy but breakthrough in medicine and science and technology we will soon lie down thousand of mile of power line that can carry new energy to city and town across this country and we will put american to work make our home and building much efficient so that we can save billion of dollar on our energy bill but to truly transform our economy to protect our security and save our planet from the ravage of climate change we need to ultimately make clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so i ask this congress to send me legislation that place a market base cap on carbon pollution and drive the production of much renewable energy in america that's what we need and to support that innovation we will invest billion a year to develop technology like wind power and solar power advance biofuel clean coal and much efficient car and truck build right here in america speak of our auto industry everyone recognize that year of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have push our automaker to the brink we should not and will not protect them from their own bad practice but we be commit to the goal of a retool reimagined auto industry that can compete and win million of job depend on it score of community depend on it and i believe the nation that invent the automobile cannot walk away from it now none of this will come without cost nor will it be easy but this be america we don't do what's easy we do what's necessary to move this country forward and for that same reason we must also address the crush cost of health care this be a cost that now cause a bankruptcy in america every second by the end of the year it can cause million american to lose their home in the last year premium have grow four time fast than wage and in each of this year million much american have lose their health insurance it be one of the major reason why small business close their door and corporation ship job overseas and it's one of the large and fast grow part of our budget give this fact we can no long afford to put health care reform on hold we can't afford to do it it's time already we've do much to advance the cause of health care reform in the last day than we've do in the last decade when it be day old this congress pass a law to provide and protect health insurance for million american child whose parent work full time our recovery plan will invest in electronic health record a new technology that will reduce error bring down cost ensure privacy and save life it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that have touch the life of nearly every american include me by seek a cure for cancer in our time and it make the large investment ever in preventive care because that's one of the good way to keep our people healthy and our cost under control this budget build on this reform it include a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform a down payment on the principle that we must have quality affordable health care for every american it's a commitment that's pay for in part by efficiency in our system that be long overdue and it's a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the year to come now there will be many different opinion and idea about how to achieve reform and that's why i'm bring together business and worker doctor and health care provider democrat and republican to begin work on this issue next week i suffer no illusion that this will be a easy process once again it will be hard but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first call for reform the cost of our health care have weigh down our economy and our conscience long enough so let there be no doubt health care reform cannot wait it must not wait and it will not wait another year the 3 challenge we must address be the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america in a global economy where the much valuable skill you can sell be your knowledge a good education be no long just a pathway to opportunity it be a prerequisite right now three quarter of the fast grow occupation require much than a high school diploma and yet just over half of our citizen have that level of education we have one of the high high school dropout rate of any industrialize nation and half of the student who begin college never finish this be a prescription for economic decline because we know the country that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow that be why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child have access to a complete and competitive education from the day they be bear to the day they begin a career that be a promise we have to make to the child of america already we've make historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan we've dramatically expand early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality because we know that the much formative learn come in that first year of life we've make college affordable for nearly million much student million and we have provide the resource necessary to prevent painful cut and teacher layoff that would set back our children's progress but we know that our school don't just need much resource they need much reform and that be why this budget create new teacher new incentive for teacher performance pathway for advancement and reward for success we'll invest in innovative program that be already help school meet high standard and close achievement gap and we will expand our commitment to charter school it be our responsibility as lawmaker and as educator to make this system work but it be the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it so tonight i ask every american to commit to at less year or much of high education or career train this can be community college or a year school vocational train or a apprenticeship but whatever the train may be every american will need to get much than a high school diploma and drop out of high school be no long a option it's not just quit on yourself it's quit on your country and this country need and value the talent of every american that's why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young american to complete college and meet a new goal by america will once again have the high proportion of college graduate in the world that be a goal we can meet that's a goal we can meet now i know that the price of tuition be high than ever which be why if you be will to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country we will make sure that you can afford a high education and to encourage a renew spirit of national service for this and future generation i ask congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bear the name of senator orrin hatch as good as a american who have never stop ask what he can do for his country senator edward kennedy this education policy will open the door of opportunity for our child but it be up to us to ensure they walk through them in the end there be no program or policy that can substitute for a parent for a mother or father who will attend that parent teacher conference or help with homework or turn off the tv put away the video game read to their child i speak to you not just as a president but as a father when i say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home that be not a democratic issue or a republican issue that's a american issue there be of course another responsibility we have to our child and that's the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay that be critical i agree absolutely see i know we can get some consensus in here with the deficit we inherit the cost of the crisis we face and the long term challenge we must meet it have never be much important to ensure that as our economy recover we do what it take to bring this deficit down that be critical now i'm proud that we pass a recovery plan free of earmark and i want to pass a budget next year that ensure that each dollar we spend reflect only our much important national priority and yesterday i hold a fiscal summit where i pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office my administration have also begin to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective program as you can imagine this be a process that will take some time but we have already identify trillion in saving over the next decade in this budget we will end education program that don't work and end direct payment to large agribusiness that don't need them we'll eliminate the no bid contract that have waste billion in iraq and reform our defense budget so that we're not pay for cold war era weapon system we don't use we will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program that doesn't make our senior any healthy we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally end the tax break for corporation that ship our job overseas in order to save our child from a future of debt we will also end the tax break for the wealthy percent of american now let me be clear let me be absolutely clear because i know you'll end up hear some of the same claim that roll back this tax break mean a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earn little than a year a quarter million dollar a year you will not see your tax increase a single dime i repeat not one single dime in fact not a dime in fact the recovery plan provide a tax cut that's right a tax cut for percent of work family and by the way this check be on the way now to preserve our long term fiscal health we must also address the grow cost in medicare and social security comprehensive health care reform be the good way to strengthen medicare for year to come and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security while create tax free universal saving account for all american finally because we're also suffer from a deficit of trust i be commit to restore a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget that be why this budget look ahead year and account for spend that be leave out under the old rule and for the first time that include the full cost of fight in iraq and afghanistan for year we have be a nation at war no long will we hide its price along with our outstanding national security team i'm now carefully review our policy in both war and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leave iraq to its people and responsibly end this war and with our friend and ally we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaida and combat extremism because i will not allow terrorist to plot against the american people from safe haven halfway around the world we will not allow it as we meet here tonight our man and woman in uniform stand watch abroad and much be ready to deploy to each and every one of them and to the family who bear the quiet burden of their absence american be unite in send one message we honor your service we be inspire by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support to relieve the strain on our force my budget increase the numb of our soldier and marine and to keep our sacred trust with that who serve we will raise their pay and give our veteran the expand health care and benefit that they have earn to overcome extremism we must also be vigilant in uphold the value our troop defend because there be no force in the world much powerful than the example of america and that be why i have order the close of the detention center at guantanamo bay and will seek swift and certain justice for capture terrorist because live our value doesn't make us weak it make us safe and it make us strong and that be why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the unite state of america do not torture we can make that commitment here tonight in word and deed we be show the world that a new era of engagement have begin for we know that america cannot meet the threat of this century alone but the world cannot meet them without america we cannot shun the negotiate table nor ignore the foe or force that can do us harm we be instead call to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious time demand to seek progress towards a secure and last peace between israel and her neighbor we have appoint a envoy to sustain our effort to meet the challenge of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation from pandemic disease to cyber threat to crush poverty we will strengthen old alliance forge new one and use all element of our national power and to respond to a economic crisis that be global in scope we be work with the nation of the g to restore confidence in our financial system avoid the possibility of escalate protectionism and spur demand for american good in market across the globe for the world depend on us have a strong economy just as our economy depend on the strength of the world's as we stand at this crossroad of history the eye of all people in all nation be once again upon us watch to see what we do with this moment wait for us to lead that of us gather here tonight have be call to govern in extraordinary time it be a tremendous burden but also a great privilege one that have be entrust to few generation of american for in our hand lie the ability to shape our world for good or for ill i know that it's easy to lose sight of this truth to become cynical and doubtful consume with the petty and the trivial but in my life i have also learn that hope be find in unlikely place that inspiration often come not from that with the much power or celebrity but from the dream and aspiration of ordinary american who be anything but ordinary i think of leonard abess a bank president from miami who reportedly cash out of his company take a million bonus and give it out to all people who work for him plus another who use to work for him he didn't tell anyone but when the local newspaper find out he simply say i know some of this people since i be year old it didn't feel right get the money myself i think about greensburg kansas a town that be completely destroy by a tornado but be be rebuild by its resident as a global example of how clean energy can power a entire community how it can bring job and business to a place where pile of brick and rubble once lie the tragedy be terrible say one of the man who help them rebuild but the folk here know that it also provide a incredible opportunity i think about ty'sheoma bethea the young girl from that school i visit in dillon south carolina a place where the ceiling leak the paint peel off the wall and they have to stop teach six time a day because the train barrel by their classroom she have be tell that her school be hopeless but the other day after class she go to the public library and type up a letter to the people sit in this chamber she even ask her principal for the money to buy a stamp the letter ask us for help and say we be just student try to become lawyer doctor congressman like yourself and one day president so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world we be not quitter that's what she say we be not quitter this word and this story tell us something about the spirit of the people who send us here they tell us that even in the much try time amid the much difficult circumstance there be a generosity a resilience a decency and a determination that persevere a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity their resolve must be our inspiration their concern must be our cause and we must show them and all our people that we be equal to the task before us i know look i know that we haven't agree on every issue thus far there be surely time in the future where we will part way but i also know that every american who be sit here tonight love this country and want it to succeed i know that that must be the start point for every debate we have in the come month and where we return after that debate be do that be the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common grind and if we do if we come together and lift this nation from the depth of this crisis if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity if we confront without fear the challenge of our time and summon that endure spirit of a america that do not quit then someday year from now our child can tell their child that this be the time when we perform in the word that be carve into this very chamber something worthy to be remember thank you god bless you and may god bless the unite state of america thank you
