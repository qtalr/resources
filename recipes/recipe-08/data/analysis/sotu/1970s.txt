mr speaker mr president my colleague in the congress our distinguish guest and my fellow american to address a joint session of the congress in this great chamber in which i be once privilege to serve be a honor for which i be deeply grateful the state of the union address be traditionally a occasion for a lengthy and detail account by the president of what he have accomplish in the past what he want the congress to do in the future and in a election year to lie the basis for the political issue which may be decisive in the fall occasionally there come a time when profound and far reach event command a break with tradition this be such a time i say this not only because mark the begin of a new decade in which america will celebrate its 200th birthday i say it because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our program and our institution in america need to be reform the moment have arrive to harness the vast energy and abundance of this land to the creation of a new american experience a experience rich and deep and much truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit the seventy will be a time of new beginning a time of explore both on the earth and in the heaven a time of discovery but the time have also come for emphasis on develop good way of manage what we have and of complete what man's genius have begin but leave unfinished our land this land that be ours together be a great and a good land it be also a unfinished land and the challenge of perfect it be the summon of the seventy it be in that spirit that i address myself to that great issue face our nation which be above partisanship when we speak of america's priority the first priority must always be peace for america and the world the major immediate goal of our foreign policy be to bring a end to the war in vietnam in a way that our generation will be remember not so much as the generation that suffer in war but much for the fact that we have the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation be able to keep we be make progress toward that goal the prospect for peace be far great today than they be a year ago a major part of the credit for this development go to the member of this congress who despite their difference on the conduct of the war have overwhelmingly indicate their support of a just peace by this action you have completely demolish the enemy's hope that they can gain in washington the victory our fight man have deny them in vietnam no goal can be great than to make the next generation the first in this century in which america be at peace with every nation in the world i shall discuss in detail the new concept and program design to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy which i shall submit to the congress at a late date today let me describe the direction of our new policy we have base our policy on a evaluation of the world as it be not as it be year ago at the conclusion of world war ii many of the policy which be necessary and fight then be obsolete today then because of america's overwhelm military and economic strength because of the weakness of other major free world power and the inability of score of newly independent nation to defend or even govern themselves america have to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world in two war first in korea and now in vietnam we furnish much of the money much of the arm much of the man to help other nation defend their freedom today the great industrial nation of europe as good as japan have regain their economic strength and the nation of latin america and many of the nation who acquire their freedom from colonialism after world war ii in asia and africa have a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense that be the basis of the doctrine i announce at guam neither the defense nor the development of other nation can be exclusively or primarily a american undertake the nation of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for their own good be and they themselves should determine the term of that good be we shall be faithful to our treaty commitment but we shall reduce our involvement and our presence in other nation affair to insist that other nation play a role be not a retreat from responsibility it be a share of responsibility the result of this new policy have be not to weaken our alliance but to give them new life new strength a new sense of common purpose relation with our european ally be once again strong and healthy base on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility we have initiate a new approach to latin america in which we deal with that nation as partner rather than patron the new partnership concept have be welcome in asia we have develop a historic new basis for japanese american friendship and cooperation which be the linchpin for peace in the pacific if we be to have peace in the last 3 of the century a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the unite state and the soviet union i would not underestimate our difference but we be move with precision and purpose from a era of confrontation to a era of negotiation our negotiation on strategic arm limitation and in other area will have far great chance for success if both side enter them motivate by mutual self interest rather than naive sentimentality it be with this same spirit that we have resume discussion with communist china in our talk at warsaw our concern in our relation with both this nation be to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of our difference i would be the last to suggest that the road to peace be not difficult and dangerous but i believe our new policy have contribute to the prospect that america may have the good chance since world war ii to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace and that chance will be enormously increase if we continue to have a relationship between congress and the executive in which despite difference in detail where the security of america and the peace of mankind be concern we act not as republican not as democrat but as american as we move into the decade of the seventy we have the great opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history our gross national product will increase by billion in the next year this increase alone be great than the entire growth of the american economy from to the critical question be not whether we will grow but how we will use that growth the decade of the sixty be also a period of great growth economically but in that same year period we witness the great growth of crime the great increase in inflation the great social unrest in america in year never have a nation seem to have have much and enjoy it little at heart the issue be the effectiveness of government ours have become as it continue to be and should remain a society of large expectation government help to generate this expectation it undertake to meet them yet increasingly it prove unable to do so as a people we have too many vision and too little vision now as we enter the seventy we should enter also a great age of reform of the institution of american government our purpose in this period should not be simply good management of the program of the past the time have come for a new quest a quest not for a great quantity of what we have but for a new quality of life in america a major part of the substance for a unprecedented advance in this nation's approach to its problem and opportunity be contain in much than two score legislative proposal which i send to the congress last year and which still await enactment i will offer at less a dozen much major program in the course of this session at this point i do not intend to through a detail list of what i have propose or will propose but i would like to mention three area in which urgent priority demand that we move and move now first we cannot delay long in accomplish a total reform of our welfare system when a system penalize work break up home rob recipient of dignity there be no alternative to abolish that system and adopt in its place the program of income support job train and work incentive which i recommend to the congress last year 2 the time have come to assess and reform all of our institution of government at the federal state and local level it be time for a new federalism in which after year of power flow from the people and local and state government to washington d.c it will begin to flow from washington back to the state and to the people of the unite state 3 we must adopt reform which will expand the range of opportunity for all american we can fulfill the american dream only when each person have a fair chance to fulfill his own dream this mean equal vote right equal employment opportunity and new opportunity for expand ownership because in order to be secure in their human right people need access to property right i can give similar example of the need for reform in our program for health education house transportation as good as other critical area which directly affect the good be of million of american the people of the unite state should wait no long for this reform that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life when i speak of action which would be beneficial to the american people i can think of none much important than for the congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of live now i realize it be tempt to blame someone else for inflation some blame business for raise price some blame union for ask for much wage but a review of the stark fiscal fact of the s clearly demonstrate where the primary blame for rise price must be place in the decade of the sixty the federal government spend billion much than it take in in tax in that same decade the american people pay the bill for that deficit in price increase which raise the cost of live for the average family of four by per month in america now million of american be force to go into debt today because the federal government decide to go into debt yesterday we must balance our federal budget so that american family will have a good chance to balance their family budget only with the cooperation of the congress can we meet this high priority objective of responsible government we be on the right track we have a balance budget in this administration cut much than billion out of spend plan in order to produce a surplus in and in spite of the fact that congress reduce revenue by billion i shall recommend a balance budget for but i can assure you that not only to present but to stay within a balance budget require some very hard decision it mean reject spend program which would benefit some of the people when their net effect would result in price increase for all the people it be time to quit putting good money into bad program otherwise we will end up with bad money and bad program i recognize the political popularity of spend program and particularly in a election year but unless we stop the rise in price the cost of live for million of american family will become unbearable and government's ability to plan program for progress for the future will become impossible in refer to budget cut there be one area where i have order a increase rather than a cut and that be the request of that agency with the responsibility for law enforcement we have hear a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixty in which the word war have perhaps too often be use the war on poverty the war on misery the war on disease the war on hunger but if there be one area where the word war be appropriate it be in the fight against crime we must declare and win the war against the criminal element which increasingly threaten our city our home and our life we have a tragic example of this problem in the nation's capital for whose safety the congress and the executive have the primary responsibility i doubt if many member of this congress who live much than a few block from here would dare leave their car in the capitol garage and walk home alone tonight last year this administration send to the congress separate piece of legislation deal with organize crime pornography street crime narcotic crime in the district of columbia none of this bill have reach my desk for signature i be confident that the congress will act now to adopt the legislation i place before you last year we in the executive have do everything we can under exist law but new and strong weapon be need in that fight while it be true that state and local law enforcement agency be the cut edge in the effort to eliminate street crime burglary murder my proposal to you have embody my belief that the federal government should play a great role in work in partnership with this agency that be why federal spend for local law enforcement will double that budget for the primary responsibility for crime that affect individual be with local and state rather than with federal government but in the field of organize crime narcotic pornography the federal government have a special responsibility it should fulfill and we should make washington d.c where we have the primary responsibility a example to the nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness i now turn to a subject which next to our desire for peace may good become the major concern of the american people in the decade of the seventy in the next year we shall increase our wealth by percent the profound question be do this mean we will be percent rich in a real sense percent good off percent happy or do it mean that in the year the president stand in this place will look back on a decade in which percent of our people live in metropolitan area choke by traffic suffocate by smog poison by water deafen by noise and terrorize by crime this be not the great question that concern world leader at summit conference but people do not live at the summit they live in the foothill of everyday experience and it be time for all of us to concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life the great question of the seventy be shall we surrender to our surrounding or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparation for the damage we have do to our air to our land and to our water restore nature to its natural state be a cause beyond party and beyond faction it have become a common cause of all the people of this country it be a cause of particular concern to young american because they much than we will reap the grim consequence of our failure to act on program which be need now if we be to prevent disaster late clean air clean water open space this should once again be the birthright of every american if we act now they can be we still think of air as free but clean air be not free and neither be clean water the price tag on pollution control be high through our year of past carelessness we incur a debt to nature and now that debt be be call the program i shall propose to congress will be the much comprehensive and costly program in this field in america's history it be not a program for just one year a year's plan in this field be no plan at all this be a time to look ahead not a year but year or year whatever time be require to do the job i shall propose to this congress a billion nationwide clean water program to put modern municipal waste treatment plant in every place in america where they be need to make our water clean again and do it now we have the industrial capacity if we begin now to build them all within year this program will get them build within year as our city and suburb relentlessly expand that priceless open space need for recreation area accessible to their people be swallow up often forever unless we preserve this space while they be still available we will have none to preserve therefore i shall propose new finance method for purchase open space and parkland now before they be lose to us the automobile be our bad polluter of the air adequate control require far advance in engine design and fuel composition we shall intensify our research set increasingly strict standard and strengthen enforcement procedure and we shall do it now we can no long afford to consider air and water common property free to be abuse by anyone without regard to the consequence instead we should begin now to treat them as scarce resource which we be no much free to contaminate than we be free to throw garbage into our neighbor's yard this require comprehensive new regulation it also require that to the extent possible the price of good should be make to include the cost of produce and dispose of them without damage to the environment now i realize that the argument be often make that there be a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life so that to have one we must forsake the other the answer be not to abandon growth but to redirect it for example we should turn toward end congestion and eliminate smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that create them in the first place continue vigorous economic growth provide us with the mean to enrich life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man each individual must enlist in this fight if it be to be win it have be say that no matter how many national park and historical monument we buy and develop the truly significant environment for each of us be that in which we spend percent of our time in our home in our place of work the street over which we travel street litter rundown park strip and yard dilapidated fence break window smoke automobile dingy work place all should be the object of our fresh view we have be too tolerant of our surrounding and too will to leave it to other to clean up our environment it be time for that who make massive demand on society to make some minimal demand on themselves each of us must resolve that each day he will leave his home his property the public place of the city or town a little clean a little good a little much pleasant for himself and that around him with the help of people we can do anything and without their help we can do nothing in this spirit together we can reclaim our land for ours and generation to come between now and the year over million child will be bear in the unite state where they grow up and how will much than any one thing measure the quality of american life in this year ahead this should be a warn to us for the past year our population have also be grow and shift the result be exemplify in the vast area of rural america empty out of people and of promise a 3 of our county lose population in the sixty the violent and decay central city of our great metropolitan complex be the much conspicuous area of failure in american life today i propose that before this problem become insoluble the nation develop a national growth policy in the future government decision as to where to build highway locate airport acquire land or sell land should be make with a clear objective of aid a balance growth for america in particular the federal government must be in a position to assist in the build of new city and the rebuild of old one at the same time we will carry our concern with the quality of life in america to the farm as good as the suburb to the village as good as to the city what rural america need much be a new kind of assistance it need to be deal with not as a separate nation but as part of a overall growth policy for america we must create a new rural environment which will not only stem the migration to urban center but reverse it if we seize our growth as a challenge we can make the s a historic period when by conscious choice we transform our land into what we want it to become america which have pioneer in the new abundance and in the new technology be call upon today to pioneer in meet the concern which have follow in their wake in turn the wonder of science to the service of man in the majesty of this great chamber we hear the echo of america's history of debate that rock the union and that that repair it of the summon to war and the search for peace of the unite of the people the build of a nation that echo of history remind us of our root and our strength they remind us also of that special genius of american democracy which at one critical turn point after another have lead us to spot the new road to the future and give us the wisdom and the courage to take it as i look down that new road which i have try to map out today i see a new america as we celebrate our 200th anniversary year from now i see a america in which we have abolish hunger provide the mean for every family in the nation to obtain a minimum income make enormous progress in provide good house fast transportation improve health and superior education i see a america in which we have check inflation and wage a win war against crime i see a america in which we have make great stride in stop the pollution of our air clean up our water open up our park continue to explore in space much important i see a america at peace with all the nation of the world this be not a impossible dream this goal be all within our reach in time past our forefather have the vision but not the mean to achieve such goal let it not be record that we be the first american generation that have the mean but not the vision to make this dream come true but let us above all recognize a fundamental truth we can be the good clothe good feed good house people in the world enjoy clean air clean water beautiful park but we can still be the unhappy people in the world without a indefinable spirit the lift of a drive dream which have make america from its begin the hope of the world two hundred year ago this be a new nation of million people weak militarily poor economically but america mean something to the world then which can not be measure in dollar something far much important than military may listen to president thomas jefferson in we act not for ourselves alone but for the whole human race we have a spiritual quality then which catch the imagination of million of people in the world today when we be the rich and strong nation in the world let it not be record that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which make us the hope of the world at the time of our birth the demand of us in be even great than in it be no long enough to live and let live now we must live and help live we need a fresh climate in america one in which a person can breathe freely and breathe in freedom our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness be not the same thing require us to measure success or failure by new criterion even much than the program i have describe today what this nation need be a example from its elect leader in provide the spiritual and moral leadership which no program for material progress can satisfy above all let us inspire young american with a sense of excitement a sense of destiny a sense of involvement in meet the challenge we face in this great period of our history only then be they go to have any sense of satisfaction in their life the great privilege a individual can have be to serve in a cause big than himself we have such a cause how we seize the opportunity i have describe today will determine not only our future but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the last 3 of the century may god give us the wisdom the strength and above all the idealism to be worthy of that challenge so that america can fulfill its destiny of be the world's good hope for liberty for opportunity for progress and peace for all people mr speaker mr president my colleague in the congress our distinguish guest my fellow american as this 92d congress begin its session america have lose a great senator and all of us who have the privilege to know him have lose a loyal friend i have the privilege of visit senator russell in the hospital just a few day before he die he never speak about himself he only speak eloquently about the need for a strong national defense in tribute to one of the much magnificent american of all time i respectfully ask that all that here will rise in silent prayer for senator russell thank you mr speaker before i begin my formal address i want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of that who be winner in the rather spirit contest for leadership position in the house and the senate and also to express my condolence to the loser i know how both of you feel and i particularly want to join with all of the member of the house and the senate as good in congratulate the new speaker of the unite state congress to that new member of this house who may have some doubt about the possibility for advancement in the year ahead i would remind you that the speaker and i meet just year ago in this chamber as freshman member of the 80th congress as you see we both have come up in the world a bite since then mr speaker this 92d congress have a chance to be record as the great congress in america's history in this trouble year just past america have be go through a long nightmare of war and division of crime and inflation even much deeply we have go through a long dark night of the american spirit but now that night be end now we must let our spirit soar again now we be ready for the lift of a drive dream the people of this nation be eager to get on with the quest for new greatness they see challenge and they be prepare to meet that challenge it be for us here to open the door that will set free again the real greatness of this nation the genius of the american people how shall we meet this challenge how can we truly open the door and set free the full genius of our people the way in which the 92d congress answer this question will determine its place in history much importantly it can determine this nation's place in history as we enter the 3 century of our independence tonight i shall present to the congress six great goal i shall ask not simply for much new program in the old framework i shall ask to change the framework of government itself to reform the entire structure of american government so we can make it again fully responsive to the need and the wish of the american people if we act boldly if we seize this moment and achieve this goal we can close the gap between promise and performance in american government we can bring together the resource of this nation and the spirit of the american people in discuss this great goal i shall deal tonight only with matter on the domestic side of the nation's agendum i shall make a separate report to the congress and the nation next month on development in foreign policy the first of this great goal be already before the congress i urge that the unfinished business of the 91st congress be make the first priority business of the 92d congress over the next week i will call upon congress to take action on much than piece of propose legislation on which action be not complete last year the much important be welfare reform the present welfare system have become a monstrous consume outrage a outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the child it be suppose to help we may honestly disagree as we do on what to do about it but we can all agree that we must meet the challenge not by pour much money into a bad program but by abolish the present welfare system and adopt a new one so let us place a floor under the income of every family with child in america and without that demean soul stifle affront to human dignity that so blight the life of welfare child today but let us also establish a effective work incentive and a effective work requirement let us provide the mean by which much can help themselves this shall be our goal let us generously help that who be not able to help themselves but let us stop help that who be able to help themselves but refuse to do so the 2 great goal be to achieve what american have not enjoy since full prosperity in peacetime the tide of inflation have turn the rise in the cost of live which have be gather dangerous momentum in the late sixty be reduce last year inflation will be far reduce this year but as we have move from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have be move from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy we have pay a price in increase unemployment we should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy be low than in any peacetime year of the sixty this be not good enough for the man who be unemployed in the seventy we must do good for worker in peacetime and we will do good to achieve this i will submit a expansionary budget this year one that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunity for million of american it will be a full employment budget a budget design to be in balance if the economy be operate at its peak potential by spend as if we be at full employment we will help to bring about full employment i ask the congress to accept this expansionary policy to accept the concept of a full employment budget at the same time i ask the congress to cooper eat in resist expenditure that go beyond the limit of the full employment budget for as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely share prosperity we must not reignite the fire of inflation and so undermine that prosperity with the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget with the commitment of the independent federal reserve system to provide fully for the monetary need of a grow economy and with a much great effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decision in the light of the national interest and their own self interest then for the worker the farmer the consumer for american everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity much job much income much profit without inflation and without war this be a great goal and one that we can achieve together the 3 great goal be to continue the effort so dramatically begin last year to restore and enhance our natural environment build on the foundation lay in the point program that i submit to congress last year i will propose a strong new set of initiative to clean up our air and water to combat noise and to preserve and restore our surrounding i will propose program to make good use of our land to encourage a balance national growth growth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in america and not only to meet today's need but to anticipate that of tomorrow i will put forward the much extensive program ever propose by a president of the unite state to expand the nation's park recreation area open space in a way that truly bring park to the people where the people be for only if we leave a legacy of park will the next generation have park to enjoy as a 4 great goal i will offer a far reach set of proposal for improve america's health care and make it available much fairly to much people i will propose a program to insure that no american family will be prevent from obtain basic medical care by inability to pay i will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical school to greatly increase the numb of doctor and other health personnel incentive to improve the delivery of health service to get much medical care resource into that area that have not be adequately serve to make great use of medical assistant and to slow the alarm rise in the cost of medical care new program to encourage good preventive medicine by attack the cause of disease and injury and by provide incentive to doctor to keep people good rather than just to treat them when they be sick i will also ask for a appropriation of a extra million to launch a intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer and i will ask late for whatever additional fund can effectively be use the time have come in america when the same kind of concentrate effort that split the atom and take man to the moon should be turn toward conquer this dread disease let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal america have long be the wealthy nation in the world now it be time we become the healthy nation in the world the 5 great goal be to strengthen and to renew our state and local government as we approach our 200th anniversary in we remember that this nation launch itself as a loose confederation of separate state without a workable central government at that time the mark of its leader vision be that they quickly see the need to balance the separate power of the state with a government of central power and so they give us a constitution of balance power of unity with diversity and so clear be their vision that it survive today as the old write constitution still in force in the world for almost two century since and dramatically in the s at that great turn point when the question have be between the state and the federal government that question have be resolve in favor of a strong central federal government during this time the nation grow and the nation prosper but one thing history tell us be that no great movement go in the same direction forever nation change they adapt or they slowly die the time have now come in america to reverse the flow of power and resource from the state and community to washington and start power and resource flow back from washington to the state and community and much important to the people all across america the time have come for a new partnership between the federal government and the state and locality a partnership in which we entrust the state and locality with a large share of the nation's responsibility and in which we share our federal revenue with them so that they can meet that responsibility to achieve this goal i propose to the congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue share historic in scope and bold in concept all across america today state and city be confront with a financial crisis some have already be cut back on essential service for example just recently san diego and cleveland cut back on trash collection much be catch between the prospect of bankruptcy on the one hand and add to a already crush tax burden on the other as one indication of the rise cost of local government i discover the other day that my home town of whittier california which have a population of have a large budget for than the entire federal budget be in now the time have come to take a new direction and once again to introduce a new and much creative balance to our approach to government so let us put the money where the need be and let us put the power to spend it where the people be i propose that the congress make a billion investment in renew state and local government five billion dollar of this will be in new and unrestricted fund to be use as the state and locality see fit the other billion will be provide by allocate billion of new fund and convert one 3 of the money go to the present narrow purpose aid program into federal revenue share fund for six broad purpose for urban development rural development education transportation job train and law enforcement but with the state and localites make their own decision on how it should be spend within each category for the next fiscal year this would increase total federal aid to the state and locality much than percent over the present level the revenue share proposal i send to the congress will include the safeguard against discrimination that accompany all other federal fund allocate to the state neither the president nor the congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which come from all the people to be use in a way which discriminate against some of the people the federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieve our national progress establish function that be clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be perform by the federal government new function that need to be sponsor or perform by the federal government such as that i have urge tonight in welfare and health will be add to the federal agendum whenever it make the good sense for us to act as a whole nation the federal government should and will lead the way but where state or local government can good do what need to be do let us see that they have the resource to do it there under this plan the federal government will provide the state and locality with much money and little interference and by cut down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot far let us share our resource let us share them to rescue the state and locality from the brink of financial crisis let us share them to give homeowner and wage earner a chance to escape from ever high property tax and sale tax let us share our resource for two other reason as good the first of this reason have to do with government itself and the 2 have to do it h each of us with the individual let s face it much american today be simply feed up with government at all level they will not and they should not continue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government the fact be that we have make the federal government so strong it grow muscle bind and the state and locality so weak they approach impotence if we put much power in much place we can make government much creative in much place that way we multiply the numb of people with the ability to make thing happen and we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout america the final reason i urge this historic shift be much much personal for each and for every one of us as everything seem to have grow big and much complex in america as the force that shape our life seem to have grow much distant and much impersonal a great feel of frustration have creep across this land whether it be the workingman who feel neglect the black man who feel oppress or the mother concern about her child there have be a grow feel that thing be in the saddle and ride mankind million of frustrate young american today be cry out ask not what will government do for me but what can i do how can i contribute how can i matter and so let us answer them let us say to them and let us say to all american we hear you we will give you a chance we be go to give you a new chance to have much to say about the decision that affect your future a chance to participate in government because we be go to provide much center of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community the far away government be from people the strong government become and the weak people become and a nation with a strong government and a weak people be a empty shell i reject the patronize idea that government in washington d.c be inevitably much wise much honest and much efficient than government at the local or state level the honesty and efficiency of government depend on people government at all level have good people and bad people and the way to get much good people into government be to give them much opportunity to do good thing the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington know good what be good for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local government be really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves this notion be completely foreign to the american experience local government be the government close to the people it be much responsive to the individual person it be people's government in a far much intimate way than the government in washington can ever be people come to america because they want to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where other determine their future for them what this change mean be that once again in america we be place our trust in people i have faith in people i trust the judgment of people let us give the people of america a chance a big voice in decide for themselves that question that so greatly affect their life the 6 great goal be a complete reform of the federal government itself base on a long and intensive study with the aid of the good advice obtainable i have conclude that a sweep reorganization of the executive branch be need if the government be to keep up with the time and with the need of the people i propose therefore that we reduce the present cabinet department to eight i propose that the department of state treasury defense and justice remain but that all the other department be consolidate into four human resource community development natural resource and economic development let us look at what this would be first a department deal with the concern of people as individual as member of a family a department focus on human need 2 a department concern with the community rural community and urban community and with all that it take to make a community function as a community 3 a department concern with our physical environment with the preservation and balance use of that great natural resource on which our nation depend and 4 a department concern with our prosperity with our job our business and that many activity that keep our economy run smoothly and good under this plan rather than divide up our department by narrow subject we would organize them around the great purpose of government rather than scatter responsibility by add new level of bureaucracy we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for get problem solve with this four department when we have a problem we will know where to go and the department will have the authority and the resource to do something about it over the year we have add department and create agency at the federal level each to serve a new constituency to handle a particular task and this have grow and multiply in what have become a hopeless confusion of form and function the time have come to match our structure to our purpose to look with a fresh eye to organize the government by conscious comprehensive design to meet the new need of a new era one hundred year ago abraham lincoln stand on a battlefield and speak of a government of the people by the people for the people too often since then we have become a nation of the government by the government for the government by enact this reform we can renew that principle that lincoln state so simply and so good by give everyone's voice a chance to be hear we will have government that truly be of the people by create much center of meaningful power much place where decision that really count can be make by give much people a chance to do something we can have government that truly be by the people and by set up a completely modern functional system of government at the national level we in washington will at last be able to provide government that be truly for the people i realize that what i be ask be that not only the executive branch in washington but that even this congress will have to change by give up some of its power change be hard but without change there can be no progress and for each of us the question then become not will change cause me inconvenience but will change bring progress for america give up power be hard but i would urge all of you as leader of this country to remember that the truly revere leader in world history be that who give power to people and not that who take it away as we consider this reform we will be act not for the next year or for the next year but for the next year so let us approach this six great goal with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of that great american who meet in philadelphia almost year ago to write a constitution let us leave a heritage as they do not just for our child but for million yet unborn of a nation where every american will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he know not only his vote but his idea count a system of government which will provide the mean for america to reach height of achievement undreamed of before that man who meet at philadelphia leave a great heritage because they have a vision not only of what the nation be but of what it can become as i think of that vision i recall that america be found as the land of the open door as a haven for the oppress a land of opportunity a place of refuge of hope when the first settler open the door of america three and a half century ago they come to escape persecution and to find opportunity and they leave wide the door of welcome for other to follow when the thirteen colony declare their independence almost two century ago they open the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment not just for a elite but for all to the generation that follow america's be the open door that beckon million from the old world to the new in search of a good life a free life a full life and in which by their own decision they can shape their own destiny for the black american the indian the mexican american and for that other in our land who have not have a equal chance the nation at last have begin to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity and of human dignity for all american with this change i have propose tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity we can open the door to full and effective participation in the decision that affect their life we can open the door to a new partnership among government at all level between that government and the people themselves and by so do we can open wide the door of human fulfillment for million of people here in america now and in the year to come in the next few week i will spell out in great detail the way i propose that we achieve this six great goal i ask this congress to be responsive if it be then the 92d congress your congress our congress at the end of its term will be able to look back on a record much splendid than any in our history this can be the congress that help us end the long war in the nation's history and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not have in this century a full generation of peace this can be the congress that help achieve a expand economy with full employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus of war this can be the congress that reform a welfare system that have rob recipient of their dignity and rob state and city of their resource this can be the congress that press forward the rescue of our environment and establish for the next generation a endure legacy of park for the people this can be the congress that launch a new era in american medicine in which the quality of medical care be enhance while the cost be make little burdensome but above all what this congress can be remember for be open the way to a new american revolution a peaceful revolution in which power be turn back to the people in which government at all level be refresh and renew and make truly responsive this can be a revolution as profound as far reach as excite as that first revolution almost year ago and it can mean that just year from now america will enter its 3 century as a young nation new in spirit with all the vigor and the freshness with which it begin its first century my colleague in the congress this be great goal they can make the session of this congress a great moment for america so let us pledge together to go forward together by achieve this goal to give america the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the year to come and in so do to make this the great congress in the history of this great and good country mr speaker mr president my colleague in the congress our distinguish guest my fellow american twenty five year ago i sit here as a freshman congressman along with speaker albert and listen for the first time to the president address the state of the union i shall never forget that moment the senate the diplomatic corp the supreme court the cabinet enter the chamber and then the president of the unite state as all of you be aware i have some difference with president truman he have some with me but i remember that on that day the day he address that joint session of the newly elect republican 80th congress he speak not as a partisan but as president of all the people call upon the congress to put aside partisan consideration in the national interest the greek turkish aid program the marshall plan the great foreign policy initiative which have be responsible for avoid a world war for over year be approve by the 80th congress by a bipartisan majority of which i be proud to be a part nineteen hundred seventy two be now before us it hold precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation we must not waste it i know the political pressure in this session of the congress will be great there be much candidate for the presidency in this chamber today than there probably have be at any one time in the whole history of the republic and there be a honest difference of opinion not only between the party but within each party on some foreign policy issue and on some domestic policy issue however there be great national problem that be so vital that they transcend partisanship so let us have our debate let us have our honest difference but let us join in keep the national interest first let us join in make sure that legislation the nation need do not become hostage to the political interest of any party or any person there be ample precedent in this election year for me to present you with a huge list of new proposal know full good that there would not be any possibility of your pass them if you work night and day i shall not do that i have present to the leader of the congress today a message of word discuss in some detail where the nation stand and set forth specific legislative item on which i have ask the congress to act much of this be legislation which i propose in in and also in the first session of this 92d congress and on which i feel it be essential that action be complete this year i be not present proposal which have attractive label but no hope of passage i be present only vital program which be within the capacity of this congress to enact within the capacity of the budget to finance and which i believe should be above partisanship program which deal with urgent priority for the nation which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this congress in the interest of the country in when i take the oath of office on the step of this build just year ago today the nation be end one of the much torture decade in its history the s be a time of great progress in many area but as we all know they be also time of great agony the agony of war of inflation of rapidly rise crime of deteriorate title of hope raise and disappoint and of anger and frustration that lead finally to violence and to the bad civil disorder in a century i recall this trouble not to point any finger of blame the nation be so tear in that final year of the sixty that many in both party question whether america can be govern at all the nation have make significant progress in this first year of the seventy our city be no long engulf by civil disorder our college and university have again become place of learn instead of battleground a begin have be make in preserve and protect our environment the rate of increase in crime have be slow and here in the district of columbia the one city where the federal government have direct jurisdiction serious crime in be actually reduce by percent from the year before much important because of the beginning that have be make we can say today that this year can be the year in which america may make the great progress in year toward achieve our goal of be at peace with all the nation of the world as our involvement in the war in vietnam come to a end we must now go on to build a generation of peace to achieve that goal we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense in the past year we have reduce the burden of arm for the first time in year spend on defense have be bring below spend on human resource as we look to the future we find encourage progress in our negotiation with the soviet union on limitation of strategic arm and look far into the future we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arm but until there be such a mutual agreement we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war and that be why because of rise research and development cost because of increase in military and civilian pay because of the need to proceed with new weapon system my budget for the come fiscal year will provide for a increase in defense spend strong military defense be not the enemy of peace they be the guardian of peace there can be no much misguide set of priority than one which would tempt other by weaken america and thereby endanger the peace of the world in our foreign policy we have enter a new era the world have change greatly in the year since president john kennedy say in his inaugural address we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty our policy have be carefully and deliberately adjust to meet the new reality of the new world we live in we make today only that commitment we be able and prepare to meet our commitment to freedom remain strong and unshakable but other must bear their share of the burden of defend freedom around the world and so this then be our policy we will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the unite state or of our ally we will help other nation develop the capability of defend themselves we will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitment we will act to defend our interest whenever and wherever they be threaten anyplace in the world but where our interest or our treaty commitment be not involve our role will be limit we will not intervene militarily but we will use our influence to prevent war if war come we will use our influence to stop it once it be over we will do our share in help to bind up the wound of that who have participate in it as you know i will soon be visit the people's republic of china and the soviet union i go there with no illusion we have great difference with both power we shall continue to have great difference but peace depend on the ability of great power to live together on the same planet despite their difference we would not be true to our obligation to generation yet unborn if we fail to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about that difference rather than to fight about them in the future as we look back over this century let us in the high spirit of bipartisanship recognize that we can be proud of our nation's record in foreign affair america have give much generously of itself toward maintain freedom preserve peace alleviate human suffer around the globe than any nation have ever do in the history of man we have fight four war in this century but our power have never be use to break the peace only to keep it never be use to destroy freedom only to defend it we now have within our reach the goal of insure that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spare the scourge of war turn to our problem at home we be make progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war industrial production consumer spend retail sale personal income all have be rise total employment real income be the high in history new home build start this past year reach the high level ever business and consumer confidence have both be rise interest rate be down the rate of inflation be down we can look with confidence to as the year when the back of inflation will be break now this a good record but it be not good enough not when we still have a unemployment rate of percent it be not enough to point out that this be the rate of the early peacetime year of the sixty or that if the much than million man release from the arm force and defense relate industry be still in their wartime job unemployment would be far low our goal in this country be full employment in peacetime we intend to meet that goal and we can the congress have help to meet that goal by pass our job create tax program last month the historic monetary agreement agreement that we have reach with the major european nation canada and japan will help meet it by provide new market for american product new job for american worker our budget will help meet it by be expansionary without be inflationary a job produce budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expand to full employment our program to raise farm income will help meet it by help to revitalize rural america by give to america's farmer their fair share of america's increase productivity we also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiative to stimulate much imaginative use of america's great capacity for technological advance and to direct it toward improve the quality of life for every american in reach the moon we demonstrate what miracle american technology be capable of achieve now the time have come to move much deliberately toward make full use of that technology here on earth of harness the wonder of science to the service of man i shall soon send to the congress a special message propose a new program of federal partnership in technological research and development with federal incentive to increase private research federally support research on project design to improve our everyday life in way that will range from improve mass transit to develop new system of emergency health care that can save thousand of life annually historically our superior technology and high productivity have make it possible for american worker to be the high pay in the world by far and yet for our good still to compete in world market now we face a new situation as other nation move rapidly forward in technology the answer to the new competition be not to build a wall around america but rather to remain competitive by improve our own technology still far and by increase productivity in american industry our new monetary and trade agreement will make it possible for american good to compete fairly in the world's market but they still must compete the new technology program will put to use the skill of many highly train american skill that may otherwise be waste it will also meet the grow technological challenge from abroad and it will thus help to create new industry as good as create much job for america's worker in produce for the world's market this 2 session of the 92d congress already have before it much than major administration proposal which still await action i have discuss this in the extensive write message that i have present to the congress today they include among other our program to improve life for the age to combat crime and drug abuse to improve health service and to ensure that no one will be deny need health care because of inability to pay to protect worker pension right to promote equal opportunity for member of minority and other who have be leave behind to expand consumer protection to improve the environment to revitalize rural america to help the city to launch new initiative in education to improve transportation and to put a end to costly labor tie up in transportation the west coast dock strike be a case in point this nation cannot and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie up in the future the message also include basic reform which be essential if our structure of government be to be adequate in the decade ahead they include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare system substitution of a new system that provide work requirement and work incentive for that who can help themselves income support for that who cannot help themselves and fairness to the work poor they include a billion program of federal revenue share with the state and locality as a investment in their renewal a investment also of faith in the american people they also include a sweep reorganization of the executive branch of the federal government so that it will be much efficient much responsive and able to meet the challenge of the decade ahead one year ago stand in this place i lay before the open session of this congress six great goal one of this be welfare reform that proposal have be before the congress now for nearly year my proposal on revenue share government reorganization health care and the environment have now be before the congress for nearly a year many of the other major proposal that i have refer to have be here that long or long now we can say be a year of consideration of this measure now let us join in make a year of action on them action by the congress for the nation and for the people of america now in addition there be one press need which i have not previously cover but which must be place on the national agendum we long have look in this nation to the local property tax as the main source of finance for public primary and secondary education as a result soar school cost soar property tax rate now threaten both our community and our school they threaten community because property tax which much than double in the year from to have become one of the much oppressive and discriminatory of all tax hit much cruelly at the elderly and the retire and they threaten school as hard press voter understandably reject new bond issue at the poll the problem have be give even great urgency by four recent court decision which have hold that the conventional method of finance school through local property tax be discriminatory and unconstitutional nearly year ago i name a special presidential commission to study the problem of school finance and i also direct the federal department to look into the same problem we be develop comprehensive proposal to meet this problem this issue involve two complex and interrelate set of problem support of the school and the basic relationship of federal state and local government in any tax reform under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury we be carefully review all of the tax aspect and i have this week enlist the advisory commission on intergovernmental relation in address the intergovernmental relation aspect i have ask this bipartisan commission to review our proposal for federal action to cope with the gather crisis of school finance and property tax late in the year when both commission have complete their study i shall make my final recommendation for relieve the burden of property tax and provide both fair and adequate finance for our children's education this recommendation will be revolutionary but all this recommendation however will be root in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise local school board must have control over local school as we look ahead over the come decade vast new growth and change be not only certainty they will be the dominant reality of this world and particularly of our life in america survey the certainty of rapid change we can be like a fall rider catch in the stirrup r we can sit high in the saddle the master of change direct it on a course we choose the secret of master change in today's world be to reach back to old and prove principle and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to the new reality of a new age that be what we have do in the proposal that i have lay before the congress they be root in basic principle that be as endure as human nature as robust as the american experience and they be responsive to new condition thus they represent a spirit of change that be truly renewal as we look back at that old principle we find them as timely as they be timeless we believe in independence and self reliance and the creative value of the competitive spirit we believe in full and equal opportunity for all american and in the protection of individual right and liberty we believe in the family as the keystone of the community and in the community as the keystone of the nation we believe in compassion toward that in need we believe in a system of law justice and order as the basis of a genuinely free society we believe that a person should get what he work for and that that who can should work for what they get we believe in the capacity of people to make their own decision in their own life in their own community and we believe in their right to make that decision in apply this principle we have do so with the full understand that what we seek in the seventy what our quest be be not merely for much but for good for a good quality of life for all american thus for example we be give a new measure of attention to clean up our air and water make our surrounding much attractive we be provide broad support for the art help stimulate a deep appreciation of what they can contribute to the nation's activity and to our individual life but nothing really matter much to the quality of our life than the way we treat one another than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unify society with a full generous regard for the right of other and also for the feeling of other as we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent year as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shout at one another we be regain that capacity as be customary here on this occasion i have be talk about program program be important but even much important than program be what we be as a nation what we mean as a nation to ourselves and to the world in new york harbor stand one of the much famous statue in the world the statue of liberty the gift in of the people of france to the people of the unite state this statue be much than a landmark it be a symbol a symbol of what america have mean to the world it remind us that what america have mean be not its wealth and not its power but its spirit and purpose a land that enshrine liberty and opportunity and that have hold out a hand of welcome to million in search of a good and a full and above all a free life the world's hope pour into america along with its people and that hope that dream that have be bring here from every corner of the world have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world four year from now america will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its found as a nation there be that who say that the old spirit of be dead that we no long have the strength of character the idealism the faith in our found purpose that that spirit represent that who say this do not know america we have be undergo self doubt and self criticism but this be only the other side of our grow sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty of our impatience with the slowness with which age old ill be be overcome if we be indifferent to the shortcoming of our society or complacent about our institution or blind to the linger inequity then we would have lose our way but the fact that we have that concern be evidence that our ideal deep down be still strong indeed they remind us that what be really good about america be its compassion they remind us that in the final analysis america be great not because it be strong not because it be rich but because this be a good country let us reject the narrow vision of that who would tell us that we be evil because we be not yet perfect that we be corrupt because we be not yet pure that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have go into the build of america be for naught because the build be not yet do let us see that the path we be travel be wide with room in it for all of us and that its direction be toward a good nation and a much peaceful world never have it matter much that we go forward together look at this chamber the leadership of america be here today the supreme court the cabinet the senate the house of representative together we hold the future of the nation and the conscience of the nation in our hand because this year be a election year it will be a time of great pressure if we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenge that we face we will have fail the trust of million of american and shake the confidence they have a right to place in us in their government never have a congress have a great opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the nation than this congress if we succeed in this task there will be credit enough for all not only for do what be right but do it in the right way by rise above partisan interest to serve the national interest and if we fail much than any one of us america will be the loser that be why my call upon the congress today be for a high statesmanship so that in the year to come american will look back and say because it withstand the intense pressure of a political year and achieve such great good for the american people and for the future of this nation this be truly a great congress mr speaker mr president my colleague in the congress

cannot now obtain it or afford it with vastly improve protection against catastrophic illness this will be a plan that maintain the high standard of quality in america's health care and it will not require additional tax now i recognize that other plan have be put forward that would cost billion or even billion and that would put our whole health care system under the heavy hand of the federal government this be the wrong approach this have be try abroad and it have fail it be not the way we do thing here in america this kind of plan would threaten the quality of care provide by our whole health care system the right way be one that build on the strength of the present system and one that do not destroy that strength one base on partnership not paternalism much important of all let us keep this as the guide principle of our health program government have a great role to play but we must always make sure that our doctor will be work for their patient and not for the federal government many of you will recall that in my state of the union address year ago i comment that much american today be simply feed up with government at all level and i recommend a sweep set of proposal to revitalize state and local government to make them much responsive to the people they serve i can report to you today that as a result of revenue share pass by the congress and other measure we have make progress toward that goal after year of move power from the state and the community to washington d.c we have begin move power back from washington to the state and community and much important to the people of america in this session of the congress i believe we be near the breakthrough point on effort which i have suggest proposal to let people themselves make their own decision for their own community and in particular on that to provide broad new flexibility in federal aid for community development for economic development for education and i look forward to work with the congress with member of both party in resolve whatever remain difference we have in this legislation so that we can make available nearly billion to our state and locality to use not for what a federal bureaucrat may want but for what their own people in that community want the decision should be theirs i think all of us recognize that the energy crisis have give new urgency to the need to improve public transportation not only in our city but in rural area as good the program i have propose this year will give community not only much money but also much freedom to balance their own transportation need it will mark the strong federal commitment ever to the improvement of mass transit as a essential element of the improvement of life in our town and city one goal on which all american agree be that our child should have the very good education this great nation can provide in a special message last week i recommend a numb of important new measure that can make a year of truly significant advance for our school and for the child they serve if the congress will act on this proposal much flexible fund will enable each federal dollar to meet good the particular need of each particular school district advance fund will give school authority a chance to make each year's plan know ahead of time what federal fund they be go to receive special target will give special help to the truly disadvantage among our people college student face with rise cost for their education will be able to draw on a expand program of loan and grant this advance be a need investment in america's much precious resource our next generation and i urge the congress to act on this legislation in one measure of a truly free society be the vigor with which it protect the liberty of its individual citizen as technology have advance in america it have increasingly encroach on one of that liberty what i term the right of personal privacy modern information system datum bank credit record mail list abuse electronic snoop the collection of personal datum for one purpose that may be use for another all this have leave million of american deeply concern by the privacy they cherish and the time have come therefore for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic right of privacy and to erect new safeguard to ensure that that right be respect i shall launch such a effort this year at the high level of the administration and i look forward again to work with this congress in establish a new set of standard that respect the legitimate need of society but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle of american liberty many of that in this chamber tonight will recall that it be year ago that i term the nation's welfare system a monstrous consume outrage a outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the child that it be suppose to help that system be still a outrage by improve its administration we have be able to reduce some of the abuse as a result last year for the first time in year there have be a halt in the growth of the welfare caseload but as a system our welfare program still need reform as urgently today as it do when i first propose in that we completely replace it with a different system in this final year of my administration i urge the congress to join me in mount a major new effort to replace the discredit present welfare system with one that work one that be fair to that who need help or cannot help themselves fair to the community and fair to the taxpayer and let us have as our goal that there will be no government program which make it much profitable to go on welfare than to go to work i recognize that from the debate that have take place within the congress over the past year on this program that we cannot expect enactment overnight of a new reform but i do propose that the congress and the administration together make this the year in which we discuss debate and shape such a reform so that it can be enact as quickly as possible america's own prosperity in the year ahead depend on our share fully and equitably in a expand world prosperity historic negotiation will take place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment in international market for american worker american farmer american investor and american consumer it be vital that the authority contain in the trade bill i submit to the congress be enact so that the unite state can negotiate flexibly and vigorously on behalf of american interest this negotiation can usher in a new era of international trade that not only increase the prosperity of all nation but also strengthen the peace among all nation in the past year we have make much progress toward a last structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the nation's history we can not have make that progress if we have not maintain the military strength of america thomas jefferson once observe that the price of liberty be eternal vigilance by the same token and for the same reason in today's world the price of peace be a strong defense as far as the unite state be concern in the past year we have steadily reduce the burden of national defense as a share of the budget bring it down from percent in to percent in the current year we have cut our military manpower over the past year by much than a 3 from million to million in the come year however increase expenditure will be need they will be need to assure the continue readiness of our military force to preserve present force level in the face of rise cost and to give us the military strength we must have if our security be to be maintain and if our initiative for peace be to succeed the question be not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary strength of our defense the question be whether we can afford not to maintain it and the answer to that question be no we must never allow america to become the 2 strong nation in the world i do not say this with any sense of belligerence because i recognize the fact that be recognize around the world america's military strength have always be maintain to keep the peace never to break it it have always be use to defend freedom never to destroy it the world's peace as good as our own depend on our remain as strong as we need to be as long as we need to be in this year we will be negotiate with the soviet union to place far limit on strategic nuclear arm together with our ally we will be negotiate with the nation of the warsaw pact on mutual and balance reduction of force in europe and we will continue our effort to promote peaceful economic development in latin america in africa in asia we will press for full compliance with the peace accord that bring a end to american fight in indochina include particularly a provision that promise the full possible account for that american who be miss in action and have in mind the energy crisis to which i have refer to early we will be work with the other nation of the world toward agreement on mean by which oil supply can be assure at reasonable price on a stable basis in a fair way to the consume and produce nation alike all of this be step toward a future in which the world's peace and prosperity and ours as good as a result be make much secure throughout the year that i have serve as your president i have have one override aim and that be to establish a new structure of peace in the world that can free future generation of the scourge of war i can understand that other may have different priority this have be and this will remain my first priority and the chief legacy i hope to leave from the year of my presidency this do not mean that we shall not have other priority because as we strengthen the peace we must also continue each year a steady strengthen of our society here at home our conscience require it our interest require it and we must insist upon it as we create much job as we build a good health care system as we improve our education as we develop new source of energy as we provide much abundantly for the elderly and the poor as we strengthen the system of private enterprise that produce our prosperity as we do all of this and even much we solidify that essential bond that hold us together as a nation even much importantly we advance what in the final analysis government in america be all about what it be all about be much freedom much security a good life for each one of the million people that live in this land we cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursue peace abroad but neither can ave afford to neglect peace abroad while pursue progress at home with a stable peace all be possible but without peace nothing be possible in the write message that i have just deliver to the speaker and to the president of the senate i comment that one of the continue challenge face us in the legislative process be that of the time and pace of our initiative select each year among many worthy project that that be ripe for action at that time what be true in term of our domestic initiative be true also in the world this period we now be in in the world and i say this as one who have see so much of the world not only in this past year but go back over many year we be in a period which present a juncture of historic force unique in this century they provide a opportunity we may never have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a lifetime and much not just peace in our time but peace in our children's time as good it be on the way we respond to this opportunity much than anything else that history will judge whether we in america have meet our responsibility and i be confident we will meet that great historic responsibility which be ours today it be year ago that john f kennedy and i sit in this chamber as freshman congressman hear our first state of the union address deliver by harry truman i know from my talk with him as member of the labor committee on which we both serve that neither of us then even dream that either one or both may eventually be stand in this place that

our guest i would like to add a personal word with regard to a issue that have be of great concern to all american over the past year i refer of course to the investigation of the so call watergate affair as you know i have provide to the special prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of material i believe that i have provide all the material that he need to conclude his investigation and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to clear the innocent i believe the time have come to bring that investigation and the other investigation of this matter to a end one year of watergate be enough and the time have come my colleague for not only the executive the president but the member of congress for all of us to join together in devote our full energy to this great issue that i have discuss tonight which involve the welfare of all of the american people in so many different way as good as the peace of the world i recognize that the house judiciary committee have a special responsibility in this area and i want to indicate on this occasion that i will cooperate with the judiciary committee in its investigation i will cooperate so that it can conclude its investigation make its decision and i will cooperate in any way that i consider consistent with my responsibility to the office of the presidency of the unite state there be only one limitation i will follow the precedent that have be follow by and defend by every president from george washington to lyndon b johnson of never do anything that weaken the office of the president of the unite state or impair the ability of the president of the future to make the great decision that be so essential to this nation and the world another point i should like to make very briefly like every member of the house and senate assemble here tonight i be elect to the office that i hold and like every member of the house and senate when i be elect to that office i know that i be elect for the purpose of do a job and do it as good as i possibly can and i want you to know that i have no intention whatever of ever walk away from the job that the people elect me to do for the people of the unite state now needless to say it would be understatement if i be not to admit that the year be not a very easy year for me personally or for my family and as i have already indicate the year present very great and serious problem as very great and serious opportunity be also present but my colleague this i believe with the help of god who have bless this land so richly with the cooperation of the congress and with the support of the american people we can and we will make the year a year of unprecedented progress toward our goal of build a structure of last peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the unite state of america mr speaker mr vice president member of the 94th congress and distinguish guest twenty six year ago a freshman congressman a young fellow with lot of idealism who be out to change the world stand before sam rayburn in the good of the house and solemnly swear to the same oath that all of you take yesterday a unforgettable experience and i congratulate you all two day late that same freshman stand at the back of this great chamber over there someplace as president truman all charge up by his single hand election victory report as the constitution require on the state of the union when the bipartisan applause stop president truman say i be happy to report to this 81st congress that the state of the union be good our nation be good able than ever before to meet the need of the american people and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness it be foremost among the nation of the world in the search for peace today that freshman member from michigan stand where mr truman stand and i must say to you that the state of the union be not good million of american be out of work recession and inflation be erode the money of million much price be too high and sale be too slow this year's federal deficit will be about billion next year's probably billion the national debt will rise to over billion our plant capacity and productivity be not increase fast enough we depend on other for essential energy some people question their government's ability to make hard decision and stick with them they expect washington politic as usual yet what president truman say on january be even much true in we be good able to meet our people's need all american do have a fair chance to pursue happiness not only be we still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today's prospect of attain it be infinitely bright there be million american employ at the start of now there be much than million american who have job in comparable dollar the average income of the american family have double during the past year now i want to speak very bluntly i've get bad news and i don't expect much if any applause the american people want action and it will take both the congress and the president to give them what they want progress and solution can be achieve and they will be achieve my message today be not intend to address all of the complex need of america i will send separate message make specific recommendation for domestic legislation such as the extension of general revenue share and the vote right act the moment have come to move in a new direction we can do this by fashion a new partnership between the congress on the one hand the white house on the other and the people we both represent let us mobilize the much powerful and much creative industrial nation that ever exist on this earth to put all our people to work the emphasis on our economic effort must now shift from inflation to job to bolster business and industry and to create new job i propose a year tax reduction of billion three quarter would go to individual and one quarter to promote business investment this cash rebate to individual amount to percent of tax payment a total cut of billion with a maximum of per return i call on the congress to act by april if you do and i hope you will the treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in may and the 2 by september the other one 4 of the cut about billion will go to business include farm to promote expansion and to create much job the year reduction for business would be in the form of a liberalize investment tax credit increase the rate to percent for all business this tax cut do not include the much fundamental reform need in our tax system but it point us in the right direction allow taxpayer rather than the government to spend their pay cut tax now be essential if we be to turn the economy around a tax cut offer the good hope of create much job unfortunately it will increase the size of the budget deficit therefore it be much important than ever that we take step to control the growth of federal expenditure part of our trouble be that we have be self indulgent for decade we have be vote ever increase level of government benefit and now the bill have come due we have be add so many new program that the size and the growth of the federal budget have take on a life of its own one characteristic of this program be that their cost increase automatically every year because the numb of people eligible for much of the benefit increase every year when this program be enact there be no dollar amount set no one know what they will cost all we know be that whatever they cost last year they will cost much next year it be a question of simple arithmetic unless we check the excessive growth of federal expenditure or impose on ourselves match increase in tax we will continue to run huge inflationary deficit in the federal budget if we project the current build in momentum of federal spend through the next year state federal and local government expenditure can easily comprise half of our gross national product this compare with little than a 3 in i have just conclude the process of prepare the budget submission for fiscal year in that budget i will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a numb of exist program i have also conclude that no new spend program can be initiate this year except for energy far i will not hesitate to veto any new spend program adopt by the congress as a additional step toward putting the federal government's house in order i recommend a percent limit on federal pay increase in in all government program tie to the consumer price index include social security civil service and military retirement pay and food stamp i also propose a year maximum increase of percent none of this recommend ceil limitation over which congress have final authority be easy to propose because in much case they involve anticipate payment to many many deserve people nonetheless it must be do i must emphasize that i be not ask to eliminate to reduce to freeze this payment i be merely recommend that we slow down the rate at which this payment increase and this program grow only a reduction in the growth of spend can keep federal borrow down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rate only a reduction in spend can make it possible for the federal reserve system to avoid a inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to our economy a major reduction in the growth of federal spend can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put us on the way to cure our economic ill if we don't act to slow down the rate of increase in federal spend the unite state treasury will be legally obligate to spend much than billion in fiscal year even if no new program be enact this be not matter of conjecture or prediction but again a matter of simple arithmetic the size of this number and their implication for our everyday life and the health of our economic system be shock i submit to the last congress a list of budget deferral and rescission there will be much cut recommend in the budget that i will submit even so the level of outlay for fiscal year be still much much too high not only be it too high for this year but the decision we make now will inevitably have a major and grow impact on expenditure level in future year i think this be a very fundamental issue that we the congress and i must jointly solve economic disruption we and other be experience stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum have quadruple in the last year but in all honesty we cannot put all of the blame on the oil export nation we the unite state be not blameless our grow dependence upon foreign source have be add to our vulnerability for year and year and we do nothing to prepare ourselves for such a event as the embargo of during the s this country have a surplus capacity of crude oil which we be able to make available to our trade partner whenever there be a disruption of supply this surplus capacity enable us to influence both supply and price of crude oil throughout the world our excess capacity neutralize any effort at establish a effective cartel and thus the rest of the world be assure of adequate supply of oil at reasonable price by our surplus capacity have vanish and as a consequence the latent power of the oil cartel can emerge in full force europe and japan both heavily dependent on import oil now struggle to keep their economy in balance even the unite state our country which be far much self sufficient than much other industrial country have be put under serious pressure i be propose a program which will begin to restore our country's surplus capacity in total energy in this way we will be able to assure ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consume nation but this nation and in fact the world must face the prospect of energy difficulty between now and this program will impose burden on all of us with the aim of reduce our consumption of energy and increase our production great attention have be pay to the consideration of fairness and i can assure you that the burden will not fall much harshly on that little able to bear them i be recommend a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoff of foreign oil it will require sacrifice but it and this be much important it will work i have set the follow national energy goal to assure that our future be as secure and as productive as our past first we must reduce oil import by million barrel per day by the end of this year and by million barrel per day by the end of 2 we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign supplier by 3 we must develop our energy technology and resource so that the unite state have the ability to supply a significant share of the energy need of the free world by the end of this century to attain this objective we need immediate action to cut import unfortunately in the short term there be only a limit numb of action which can increase domestic supply i will press for all of them i urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the elk hill california naval petroleum reserve in order that we make great use of domestic coal resource i be submit amendment to the energy supply and environmental coordination act which will greatly increase the numb of powerplants that can be promptly convert to coal obviously voluntary conservation continue to be essential but tough program be need and need now therefore i be use presidential power to raise the fee on all import crude oil and petroleum product the crude oil fee level will be increase per barrel on february by per barrel on march and by per barrel on april i will take action to reduce undue hardship on any geographical region the forego be interim administrative action they will be rescind when the broad but necessary legislation be enact to that end i be request the congress to act within day on a much comprehensive energy tax program it include excise tax and import fee total per barrel on product import and on all crude oil deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax i plan to take presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on april i urge the congress to enact a windfall profit tax by that date to ensure that oil producer do not profit unduly the soon congress act the much effective the oil conservation program will be and the quick the federal revenue can be return to our people i be prepare to use presidential authority to limit import as necessary to guarantee success i want you to know that before decide on my energy conservation program i consider ration and high gasoline tax as alternative in my judgment neither would achieve the desire result and both would produce unacceptable inequity a massive program must be initiate to increase energy supply to cut demand and provide new standby emergency program to achieve the independence we want by the large part of increase oil production must come from new frontier area on the outer continental shelf and from the naval petroleum reserve no in alaska it be the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration lease and production on that frontier area of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risk be acceptable use of our much abundant domestic resource coal be severely limit we must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concern with coal i be submit clean air act amendment which will allow great coal use without sacrifice clean air goal i veto the strip mine legislation pass by the last congress with appropriate change i will sign a revise version when it come to the white house i be propose a numb of action to energize our nuclear power program i will submit legislation to expedite nuclear lease license and the rapid selection of site in recent month utility have cancel or postpone over percent of plan nuclear expansion and percent of plan addition to non nuclear capacity finance problem for that industry be worsen i be therefore recommend that the year investment tax credit of percent be extend a additional year to specifically speed the construction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or oil i be also submit proposal for selective reform of state utility commission regulation to provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty i will request legislation to authorize and require tariff import quota or price floor to protect our energy price at level which will achieve energy independence increase energy supply be not enough we must take additional step to cut long term consumption i therefore propose to the congress legislation to make thermal efficiency standard mandatory for all new building in the unite state a new tax credit of up to for that homeowner who install insulation equipment the establishment of a energy conservation program to help low income family purchase insulation supply legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standard for year which will enable us to improve automobile gas mileage by percent by this proposal and action cumulatively can reduce our dependence on foreign energy supply from to million barrel per day by to make the unite state invulnerable to foreign disruption i propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of billion barrel of oil for domestic need and million barrel for national defense purpose i will ask for the fund need for energy research and development activity i have establish a goal of million barrel of synthetic fuel and shale oil production per day by together with a incentive program to achieve it i have a very deep belief in america's capability within the next year my program envision major nuclear powerplants major new coal mine major coal fire powerplants major new oil refinery major new synthetic fuel plant the drill of many thousand of new oil well the insulation of million home and the manufacture and the sale of million of new automobile truck and bus that use much little fuel i happen to believe that we can do it in another crisis the one in president franklin have roosevelt say this country would build military aircraft by production in that program have reach aircraft annually they do it then we can do it now if the congress and the american people will work with me to attain this target they will be achieve and will be surpass from adversity let us seize opportunity revenue of some billion from high energy tax design to encourage conservation must be refund to the american people in a manner which correct distortion in our tax system work by inflation people have be push into high tax bracket by inflation with consequent reduction in their actual spend power business tax be similarly distort because inflation exaggerate report profit result in excessive tax accordingly i propose that future individual income tax be reduce by billion this will be do by raise the low income allowance and reduce tax rate this continue tax cut will primarily benefit low and middle income taxpayer for example a typical family of four with a gross income of now pay in federal income tax under this tax cut plan they would pay nothing a family of four with a gross income of now pay in federal tax my proposal reduce that total by family gross would receive a reduction of that with the very low income who can less afford high cost must also be compensate i propose a payment of to every person year of age and old in that very limit category state and local government will receive billion in additional revenue share to offset their increase energy cost to offset inflationary distortion and to generate much economic activity the corporate tax rate will be reduce from percent to percent now let me turn if i may to the international dimension of the present crisis at no time in our peacetime history have the state of the nation depend much heavily on the state of the world and seldom if ever have the state of the world depend much heavily on the state of our nation the economic distress be global we will not solve it at home unless we help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad world trade and monetary structure provide market energy food and vital raw material for all nation this international system be now in jeopardy this nation can be proud of significant achievement in recent year in solve problem and crisis the berlin agreement the salt agreement our new relationship with china the unprecedented effort in the middle east be immensely encourage but the world be not free from crisis in a world of nation where nuclear technology be proliferate and regional conflict continue international security cannot be take for grant so let there be no mistake about it international cooperation be a vital factor of our life today this be not a moment for the american people to turn inward much than ever before our own good be depend on america's determination and america's leadership in the whole wide world we be a great nation spiritually politically militarily diplomatically and economically america's commitment to international security have sustain the safety of ally and friend in many area in the middle east in europe and in asia our turn away would unleash new instability new danger around the globe which in turn would threaten our own security at the end of world war ii we turn a similar challenge into a historic opportunity and i may add a historic achievement a old order be in disarray political and economic institution be shatter in that period this nation and its partner build new institution new mechanism of mutual support and cooperation today as then we face a historic opportunity if we act imaginatively and boldly as we act then this period will in retrospect be see as one of the great creative moment of our nation's history the whole world be watch to see how we respond a resurgent american economy would do much to restore the confidence of the world in its own future than anything else we can do the program that this congress pass can demonstrate to the world that we have start to put our own house in order if we can show that this nation be able and will to help other nation meet the common challenge it can demonstrate that the unite state will fulfill its responsibility as a leader among nation quite frankly at stake be the future of industrialize democracy which have perceive their destiny in common and sustain it in common for year the develop nation be also at a turn point the poor nation see their hope of feed their hungry and develop their society shatter by the economic crisis the long term economic future for the producer of raw material also depend on cooperative solution our relation with the communist country be a basic factor of the world environment we must seek to build a long term basis for coexistence we will stand by our principle we will stand by our interest we will act firmly when challenge the kind of a world we want depend on a broad policy of create mutual incentive for restraint and for cooperation as we move forward to meet our global challenge and opportunity we must have the tool to do the job our military force be strong and ready this military strength deter aggression against our ally stabilize our relation with former adversary and protect our homeland fully adequate conventional and strategic force cost many many billion but this dollar be sound insurance for our safety and for a much peaceful world military strength alone be not sufficient effective diplomacy be also essential in prevent conflict in build world understand the vladivostok negotiation with the soviet union represent a major step in moderate strategic arm competition my recent discussion with the leader of the atlantic community japan and south korea have contribute to meet the common challenge but we have serious problem before us that require cooperation between the president and the congress by the constitution and tradition the execution of foreign policy be the responsibility of the president in recent year under the stress of the vietnam war legislative restriction on the president's ability to execute foreign policy and military decision have proliferate as a member of the congress i oppose some and i approve other as president i welcome the advice and cooperation of the house and the senate but if our foreign policy be to be successful we cannot rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the president to act the conduct of negotiation be ill suit to such limitation legislative restriction intend for the good motive and purpose can have the opposite result as we have see much recently in our trade relation with the soviet union for my part i pledge this administration will act in the close consultation with the congress as we face delicate situation and trouble time throughout the globe when i become president only month ago i promise the last congress a policy of communication conciliation compromise and cooperation i renew that pledge to the new member of this congress let me sum it up america need a new direction which i have seek to chart here today a change of course which will put the unemployed back to work increase real income and production restrain the growth of federal government spend achieve energy independence and advance the cause of world understand we have the ability we have the know how in partnership with the american people we will achieve this objective as our 200th anniversary approach we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to rebuild our political and economic strength let us make america once again and for century much to come what it have so long be a stronghold and a beacon light of liberty for the whole world thank you mr speaker mr vice president member of the 94th congress and distinguish guest as we begin our bicentennial america be still one of the young nation in record history long before our forefather come to this shore man and woman have be struggle on this planet to forge a good life for themselves and their family in man's long upward march from savagery and slavery throughout the nearly year of the christian calendar the nearly year of jewish reckon there have be many deep terrify valley but also many bright and tower peak one peak stand high in the range of human history one example shine forth of a people unite to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom one union hold out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen that union be the unite state of america we have not remake paradise on earth we know perfection will not be find here but think for a minute how far we have come in year we come from many root and we have many branch yet all american across the eight generation that separate us from the stir deed of that who know no other homeland and that who just find refuge among our shore say in unison i be proud of america and i be proud to be a american life will be a little good here for my child than for me i believe this not because i be tell to believe it but because life have be good for me than it be for my father and my mother i know it will be good for my child because my hand my brain my voice and my vote can help make it happen it have happen here in america it have happen to you and to me government exist to create and preserve condition in which people can translate their idea into practical reality in the good of time much be lose in translation but we try sometimes we have try and fail always we have have the good of intention but in the recent past we sometimes forget the sound principle that guide us through much of our history we want to accomplish great thing and solve age old problem and we become overconfident of our ability we try to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home we think we can transform the country through massive national program but often the program do not work too often they only make thing bad in our rush to accomplish great deed quickly we trample on sound principle of restraint and endanger the right of individual we unbalance our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditure and borrow and we be not totally honest with ourselves about how much this program would cost and how we would pay for them finally we shift our emphasis from defense to domestic problem while our adversary continue a massive buildup of arm the time have now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new realism that be true to the great principle upon which this nation be found we must introduce a new balance to our economy a balance that favor not only sound active government but also a much much vigorous healthy economy that can create new job and hold down price we must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government a balance that favor great individual freedom and self reliance we must strike a new balance in our system of federalism a balance that favor great responsibility and freedom for the leader of our state and local government we must introduce a new balance between the spend on domestic program and spend on defense a balance that ensure we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protect our security in a world that be still hostile to freedom and in all that we do we must be much honest with the american people promise them no much than we can deliver and deliver all that we promise the genius of america have be its incredible ability to improve the life of its citizen through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity history and experience tell us that moral progress cannot come in comfortable and in complacent time but out of trial and out of confusion tom paine arouse the trouble american of to stand up to the time that try men's soul because the hard the conflict the much glorious the triumph just a year ago i report that the state of the union be not good tonight i report that the state of our union be good in many way a lot good but still not good enough to paraphrase tom paine be not a year for summer soldier and sum shine patriot it be a year of fear and alarm and of dire forecast much of which never happen and won't happen as you recall the year open with rancor and with bitterness political misdeed of the past have neither be forget nor forgive the long much divisive war in our history be wind toward a unhappy conclusion many fear that the end of that foreign war of man and machine mean the begin of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal friend and adversary abroad be ask whether america have lose its nerve finally our economy be ravage by inflation inflation that be plunge us into the bad recession in four decade at the same time american become increasingly alienate from big institution they be steadily lose confidence not just in big government but in big business big labor and big education among other ours be a trouble land and so be a year of hard decision difficult compromise and a new realism that teach us something important about america it bring back a need measure of common sense steadfastness and self discipline american do not panic or demand instant but useless cure in all sector people meet their difficult problem with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage add up the separate piece of progress in subtract the setback and the sum total show that we be not only head in a new direction a direction which i propose month ago but it turn out to be the right direction it be the right direction because it follow the truly revolutionary american concept of which hold that in a free society the make of public policy and successful problemsolving involve much much than government it involve a full partnership among all branch and all level of government private institution and individual citizen common sense tell me to stick to that steady course take the state of our economy last january much thing be rapidly get bad this january much thing be slowly but surely get good the bad recession since world war ii turn around in april the good cost of live news of the past year be that double digit inflation of percent or high be cut almost in half the bad unemployment remain far too high today nearly much american be work than at the bottom of the recession at year's end people be again be hire much fast than they be be lay off yet let's be honest many american have not yet feel this change in their daily life they still see price go up far too fast and they still know the fear of unemployment we be also a grow nation we need much and much job every year today's economy have produce over million job for american but we need a lot much job especially for the young my first objective be to have sound economic growth without inflation we all know from recent experience what runaway inflation do to ruin every other worthy purpose we be slow it we must stop it cold for many american the way to a healthy noninflationary economy have become increasingly apparent the government must stop spend so much and stop borrow so much of our money much money must remain in private hand where it will do the much good to hold down the cost of live we must hold down the cost of government in the past decade the federal budget have be grow at a average rate of over percent a year the budget i be submit wednesday cut this rate of growth in half i have keep my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of billion in fact it be billion by hold down the growth of federal spend we can afford additional tax cut and return to the people who pay tax much decisionmaking power over their own life last month i sign legislation to extend the tax reduction for the first month of this year i now propose that effective july we give our taxpayer a tax cut of approximately billion much than congress agree to in december my broad tax reduction would mean that for a family of four make a year there will be much in take home pay annually hardworking american catch in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash my recommendation for a firm restraint on the growth of federal spend and for great tax reduction be simple and straightforward for every dollar save in cut the growth in the federal budget we can have a add dollar of federal tax reduction we can achieve a balance budget by if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of federal spend one test of a healthy economy be a job for every american who want to work government our kind of government cannot create that many job but the federal government can create condition and incentive for private business and industry to make much and much job five out of six job in this country be in private business and in industry common sense tell us this be the place to look for much job and to find them fast i mean real reward permanent job to achieve this we must offer the american people great incentive to invest in the future my tax proposal be a major step in that direction to supplement this proposal i ask that congress enact change in federal tax law that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment my recommendation will concentrate this job creation tax incentive in area where the unemployment rate now run over percent legislation to get this start must be approve at the early possible date within the strict budget total that i will recommend for the come year i will ask for additional house assistance for family this program will expand house opportunity spur construction and help to house moderate and low income family we have a disappoint year in the house industry in but with low interest rate and available mortgage money we can have a healthy recovery in a necessary condition of a healthy economy be freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation we be waste literally million of work hour cost billion of taxpayer and consumer dollar because of bureaucratic redtape the american farmer who now feed million american but also million worldwide have show how touch much he can produce without the shackle of government control now we badly need reform in other key area in our economy the airline truck railroad and financial institution i have submit concrete plan in each of this area not to help this or that industry but to foster competition and to bring price down for the consumer this administration in addition will strictly enforce the federal antitrust law for the very same purpose take a long look at america's future there can be neither sustain growth nor much job unless we continue to have a assure supply of energy to run our economy domestic production of oil and gas be still decline our dependence on foreign oil at high price be still too great drain job and dollar away from our own economy at the rate of per year for every american last month i sign a compromise national energy bill which enact a part of my comprehensive energy independence program this legislation be late not the complete answer to energy independence but still a start in the right direction i again urge the congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposal to make america invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel my proposal as all of you know would reduce domestic natural gas shortage allow production from federal petroleum reserve stimulate effective conservation include revitalization of our railroad and the expansion of our urban transportation system develop much and clean energy from our vast coal resource expedite clean and safe nuclear power production create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the sun and the earth for this and future generation also i ask for the sake of future generation that we preserve the family farm and family own small business both strengthen america and give stability to our economy i will propose estate tax change so that family business and family farm can be hand down from generation to generation without have to be sell to pay tax i propose tax change to encourage people to invest in america's future and their own through a plan that give moderate income family income tax benefit if they make long term investment in common stock in american company the federal government must and will respond to clear cut national need for this and future generation hospital and medical service in america be among the good in the world but the cost of a serious and extend illness can quickly wipe out a family's lifetime saving increase health cost be of deep concern to all and a powerful force push up the cost of live the burden of catastrophic illness can be bear by very few in our society we must eliminate this fear from every family i propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody cover by medicare to finance this add protection fee for short term care will go up somewhat but nobody after reach age will have to pay much than a year for cover hospital or nurse home care nor much than for year's doctor bill we cannot realistically afford federally dictate national health insurance provide full coverage for all million american the experience of other country raise question about the quality as good as the cost of such plan but i do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer much middle income family high quality health service at price they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illness use resource now available i propose improve the medicare and other federal health program to help that who really need protection old people and the poor to help state and local government give good health care to the poor i propose that we combine exist federal program include medicaid into a single billion federal grant fund would be divide among state under a new formula which provide a large share of federal money to that state that have a large share of low income family i will take far step to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for that who have serve in our arm force now let me speak about social security our federal social security system for people who have work and contribute to it for all their life be a vital part of our economic system its value be no long debatable in my budget for fiscal year i be recommend that the full cost of live increase in the social security benefit be pay during the come year but i be concern about the integrity of our social security trust fund that enable people that retire and that still work who will retire to count on this source of retirement income young worker watch their deduction rise and wonder if they will be adequately protect in the future we must meet this challenge head on simple arithmetic warn all of us that the social security trust fund be head for trouble unless we act soon to make sure the fund take in as much as it pay out there will be no security for old or for young i must therefore recommend a three tenth of percent increase in both employer and employee social security tax effective january this will cost each cover employee little than extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund as we rebuild our economy we have a continue responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed at my request the congress enact two extension and two expansion in unemployment insurance which help that who be jobless during this program will continue in in my fiscal year budget i be also request fund to continue prove job train and employment opportunity program for million of other american compassion and a sense of community two of america's great strength throughout our history tell us we must take care of our neighbor who cannot take care of themselves the host of federal program in this field reflect our generosity as a people but everyone realize that when it come to welfare government at all level be not do the job good too many of our welfare program be inequitable and invite abuse too many of our welfare program have problem from begin to end bad we be waste badly need resource without reach many of the truly needy complex welfare program cannot be reform overnight surely we cannot simply dump welfare into the lap of the state their local taxpayer or their private charity and just walk away from it nor be it the right time for massive and sweep change while we be still recover from the recession nevertheless there be still plenty of improvement that we can make i will ask congress for presidential authority to tighten up the rule for eligibility and benefit last year i twice seek long overdue reform of the scandal riddle food stamp program this year i say again let's give food stamp to that much in need let's not give any to that who don't need them protect the life and property of the citizen at home be the responsibility of all public official but be primarily the job of local and state law enforcement authority american have always find the very think of a federal police force repugnant and so do i but there be proper way in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the constitution charge us my recommendation on how to control violent crime be submit to the congress last june with strong emphasis on protect the innocent victim of crime to keep a convict criminal from commit much crime we must put him in prison so he cannot harm much law abide citizen to be effective this punishment must be swift and it must be certain too often criminal be not send to prison after conviction but be allow to return to the street some judge be reluctant to send convict criminal to prison because of inadequate facility to alleviate this problem at the federal level my new budget propose the construction of four new federal facility to speed federal justice i propose a increase this year in the unite state attorney prosecute federal crime and the reinforcement of the numb of unite state marshal additional federal judge be need as recommend by me and the judicial conference another major threat to every american's person and property be the criminal carry a handgun the way to cut down on the criminal use of gun be not to take gun away from the law abide citizen but to impose mandatory sentence for crime in which a gun be use make it hard to obtain cheap gun for criminal purpose and concentrate gun control enforcement in highcrime area my budget recommend additional federal agent in the large metropolitan high crime area to help local authority stop criminal from sell and use handgun the sale of hard drug be tragically on the increase again i have direct all agency of the federal government to step up law enforcement effort against that who deal in drug in i be glad to report federal agent seize substantially much heroin come into our country than in as president i have talk personally with the leader of mexico colombia and turkey to urge great effort by their government to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drug i recommend month ago that the congress enact mandatory fix sentence for person convict of federal crime involve the sale of hard drug hard drug we all know degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their user it be unrealistic and mislead to hold out the hope that the federal government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime under the constitution the great responsibility for curb crime lie with state and local authority they be the frontline fighter in the war against crime there be definite way in which the federal government can help them i will propose in the new budget that congress authorize almost billion over the next year to assist state and local government to protect the safety and property of all their citizen as president i pledge the strict enforcement of federal law and by example support and leadership to help state and local authority enforce their law together we must protect the victim of crime and ensure domestic tranquility last year i strongly recommend a year extension of the exist revenue share legislation which thus far have provide 23ѕ billion to help state and local unit of government solve problem at home this program have be effective with decisionmaking transfer from the federal government to locally elect official congress must act this year or state and local unit of government will have to drop program or raise local tax include my health care program reform i propose to consolidate some separate federal program and provide flexible federal dollar grant to help state city and local agency in such important area as education child nutrition and social service this flexible system will do the job good and do it close to home the protection of the life and property of american from foreign enemy be one of my primary responsibility as president in a world of instant communication and intercontinental ballistic missile in a world economy that be global and interdependent our relation with other nation become much not little important to the life of american america have have a unique role in the world since the day of our independence year ago and ever since the end of world war ii we have bear successfully a heavy responsibility for ensure a stable world order and hope for human progress today the state of our foreign policy be sound and strong we be at peace and i will do all in my power to keep it that way our military force be capable and ready our military power be without equal and i intend to keep it that way our principal alliance with the industrial democracy of the atlantic community and japan have never be much solid a far agreement to limit the strategic arm race may be achieve we have a improve relationship with china the world's much populous nation the key element for peace among the nation of the middle east now exist our traditional friendship in latin america africa and asia continue we have take the role of leadership in launch a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the develop world we have help to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system we should be proud of what america what our country have accomplish in this area and i believe the american people be the american people have hear too much about how terrible our mistake how evil our deed and how misguide our purpose the american people know good the truth be we be the world's great democracy we remain the symbol of man's aspiration for liberty and good be we be the embodiment of hope for progress i say it be time we quit downgrade ourselves as a nation of course it be our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistake it be our duty to see that they never happen again but our great duty be to look to the future the world's trouble will not go away the american people want strong and effective international and defense policy in our constitutional system this policy should reflect consultation and accommodation between the president and the congress but in the final analysis as the framer of our constitution know from hard experience the foreign relation of the unite state can be conduct effectively only if there be strong central direction that allow flexibility of action that responsibility clearly rest with the president i pledge to the american people policy which seek a secure just and peaceful world i pledge to the congress to work with you to that end we must not face a future in which we can no long help our friend such as angola even in limit and carefully control way we must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention some hasty action of the congress during the past year much recently in respect to angola be in my view very shortsighted unfortunately they be still very much on the mind of our ally and our adversary a strong defense posture give weight to our value and our view in international negotiation it assure the vigor of our alliance and it sustain our effort to promote settlement of international conflict only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balance agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arm only a balance agreement will serve our interest and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation the defense budget i will submit to the congress for fiscal year will show a essential increase over the current year it provide for real growth in purchase power over this year's defense budget which include the cost of the all volunteer force we be continue to make economy to enhance the efficiency of our military force but the budget i will submit represent the necessity of american strength for the real world in which we live as conflict and rivalry persist in the world our unite state intelligence capability must be the good in the world the cripple of our foreign intelligence service increase the danger of american involvement in direct arm conflict our adversary be encourage to attempt new adventure while our own ability to monitor event and to influence event short of military action be undermine without effective intelligence capability the unite state stand blindfold and hobble in the near future i will take action to reform and strengthen our intelligence community i ask for your positive cooperation it be time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure a effective responsible and responsive intelligence capability tonight i have speak about our problem at home and abroad i have recommend policy that will meet the challenge of our 3 century i have no doubt that our union will endure good strong and with much individual freedom we can see forward only dimly year year a generation perhaps like our forefather we know that if we meet the challenge of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction if we remain true to our constitution and to our ideal then we can know that the future will be good than the past i see america today cross a threshold not just because it be our bicentennial but because we have be test in adversity we have take a new look at what we want to be and what we want our nation to become i see america resurgent certain once again that life will be good for our child than it be for us seek strength that cannot be count in megaton and rich that cannot be erode by inflation i see this unite state of america move forward as before toward a much perfect union where the government serve and the people rule we will not make this happen simply by make speech good or bad yours or mine but by hard work and hard decision make with courage and with common sense i have hear many inspire presidential speech but the word i remember good be speak by dwight have eisenhower america be not good because it be great the president say america be great because it be good president eisenhower be raise in a poor but religious home in the heart of america his simple word echo president lincoln's eloquent testament that right make may and lincoln in turn evoke the silent image of george washington kneel in prayer at valley forge so all this magic memory which link eight generation of american be sum up in the inscription just above me how many time have we see it in god we trust let us engrave it now in each of our heart as we begin our bicentennial mr speaker mr vice president member of the 95th congress and distinguish guest in accordance with the constitution i come before you once again to report on the state of the union this report will be my last maybe laughter but for the union it be only the first of such report in our 3 century of independence the close of which none of us will ever see we can be confident however that year from now a freely elect president will come before a freely elect congress choose to renew our great republic's pledge to the government of the people by the people and for the people for my part i pray the 3 century we be begin will bring to all american our child and their children's child a great measure of individual equality opportunity and justice a great abundance of spiritual and material blessing and a high quality of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the state of the union be a measurement of the many element of which it be compose a political union of diverse state a economic union of vary interest a intellectual union of common conviction and a moral union of immutable ideal take in sum i

orderly transition of governmental responsibility of problem as good as of position of burden as good as of power the genius of the american system be that we do this so naturally and so normally there be no soldier march in the street except in the inaugural parade no public demonstration except for some of the dancer at the inaugural ball the opposition party doesn't go underground but go on function vigorously in the congress and in the country and our vigilant press go right on probe and publish our fault and our folly confirm the wisdom of the framer of the first amendment because of

use of ocean i be gratify by this accomplishment they constitute a record of broad success for america and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind this administration leave to its successor a world in good condition than we find we leave as good a solid foundation for progress on a range of issue that be vital to the good be of america what have be achieve in the field of foreign affair and what can be accomplish by the new administration demonstrate the genius of american work together for the common good it be this our remarkable ability to work together that have make us a unique nation it be congress the president and the people strive for a good world i know all patriotic american want this nation's foreign policy to succeed i urge member of my party in this congress to give the new president loyal support in this area i express the hope that this new congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affair the exclusive right to declare war the duty to advise and consent on the part of the senate the power of the purse on the part of the house be ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guard but because we may have be too careless of this power in the past do not justify congressional intrusion into or obstruction of the proper exercise of presidential responsibility now or in the future there can be only one commander in chief in this time crisis cannot be manage and war cannot be wage by committee nor can peace be pursue solely by parliamentary debate to the ear of the world the president speak for the nation while he be of course ultimately accountable to the congress the court and the people he and his emissary must not be handicap in advance in their relation with foreign government as have sometimes happen in the past at home i be encourage by the nation's recovery from the recession and our steady return to sound economic growth it be now continue after the recent period of uncertainty which be part of the price we pay for free election our much press need today and the future be much job productive permanent job create by a thrive economy we must revise our tax system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment necessary for the creation of productive job for all american who want to work early this month i propose a permanent income tax reduction of billion below current level include raise the personal exemption from to i also recommend a series of measure to stimulate investment such as accelerate depreciation for new plant and equipment in area of high unemployment a reduction in the corporate tax rate from to percent and eliminate the present double taxation of dividend i strongly urge the congress to pass this measure to help create the productive permanent job in the private economy that be so essential for our future all the basic trend be good we be not on the brink of another recession or economic disaster if we follow prudent policy that encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation we will come out on top and i be sure we will we have successfully cut inflation by much than half when i take office the consumer price index be rise at percent a year during the rate of inflation be percent we have create much job over million much job today than in the spring of throughout this nation today we have over million people in useful productive job much than at any other time in our nation's history but there be still too many american unemployed this be the great regret that i have as i leave office we bring about with the congress after much delay the renewal of the general revenue share we expand community development and federal manpower program we begin a significant urban mass transit program federal program today provide much fund for our state and local government than ever before billion for the current fiscal year through this program and other that provide aid directly to individual we have keep faith with our tradition of compassionate help for that who need it as we begin our 3 century we can be proud of the progress that we have make in meet human need for all of our citizen we have cut the growth of crime by nearly percent two year ago crime be increase at the rate of percent annually in the first three quarter of that growth rate have be cut to percent but crime and the fear of crime remain one of the much serious problem face our citizen we have have some success and there have be some disappointment bluntly i must remind you that we have not make satisfactory progress toward achieve energy independence energy be absolutely vital to the defense of our country to the strength of our economy and to the quality of our life two year ago i propose to the congress the first comprehensive national energy program a specific and coordinate set of measure that would end our vulnerability to embargo blockade or arbitrary price increase and would mobilize u.s technology and resource to supply a significant share of the free world's energy after of the major energy proposal i submit year ago only half belatedly become law in we be dependent upon foreign oil import for percent of our need today we be percent dependent and we'll pay out billion for foreign oil this year such vulnerability at present or in the future be intolerable and must be end the answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today remind me of the old argument about whether the tank be half full or half empty the pessimist will say we have half fail to achieve our year energy goal the optimist will say that we have half succeed i be always a optimist but we must make up for lose time we have lay a solid foundation for complete the enormous task which confront us i have sign into law five major energy bill which contain significant measure for conservation resource development stockpile and standby authority we have move forward to develop the naval petroleum reserve to build a million barrel strategic petroleum stockpile to phase out unnecessary government allocation and price control to develop a last relationship with other oil consume nation to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobile building and industry and to expand research on new technology and renewable resource such as wind power geothermal and solar energy all this action significant as they be for the long term be only the begin i recently submit to the congress my proposal to reorganize the federal energy structure and the hard choice which remain if we be serious about reduce our dependence upon foreign energy this include program to reverse our decline production of natural gas and increase incentive for domestic crude oil production i propose to minimize environmental uncertainty affect coal development expand nuclear power generation and create a energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy program where private capital be not available we must explore every reasonable prospect for meet our energy need when our current domestic reserve of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade i urgently ask congress and the new administration to move quickly on this issue this nation have the resource and the capability to achieve our energy goal if its government have the will to proceed and i think we do i have be disappoint by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reform which i contemplate for the federal government although a start have be make for example the federal judicial system have long serve as a modal for other court but today it be threaten by a shortage of qualify federal judge and a explosion of litigation claim federal jurisdiction i commend to the new administration and the congress the recent report and recommendation of the department of justice undertake at my request on the need of the federal court i especially endorse its proposal for a new commission on the judicial appointment process while the judicial branch of our government may require reinforcement the budget and payroll of the other branch remain stagger i cannot help but observe that while the white house staff and the executive office of the president have be reduce and the total numb of civilian in the executive branch contain during the s the legislative branch have increase substantially although the membership of the congress remain at congress now cost the taxpayer much than a million dollar per member the whole legislative budget have pass the billion dollar mark set out to reduce the growth in the size and spend of the federal government but no president can accomplish this alone the congress sidetrack much of my request for authority to consolidate overlap program and agency to return much decisionmaking and responsibility to state and local government through block grant instead of rigid categorical program and to eliminate unnecessary red tape and outrageously complex regulation we have make some progress in cut back the expansion of government and its intrusion into individual life but believe me there be much much to be do and you and i know it it can only be do by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a congress as prepare as the president to face up to this very real political problem again i wish my successor work with a substantial majority of his own party the good of success in reform the costly and cumbersome machinery of the federal government the task of self government be never finish the problem be great the opportunity be great america's first goal be and always will be peace with honor america must remain first in keep peace in the world we can remain first in peace only if we be never 2 in defense in present the state of the union to the congress and to the american people i have a special obligation as commander in chief to report on our national defense our survival as a free and independent people require above all strong military force that be good equip and highly train to perform their assign mission i be particularly gratify to report that over the past 2ѕ year we have be able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resource this country be devote to national defense this be a immediate problem i face in the evidence be unmistakable that the soviet union have be steadily increase the resource it apply to build its military strength during this same period the unite state real defense spend decline in my three budget we not only arrest that dangerous decline but we have establish the positive trend which be essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world the vietnam war both materially and psychologically affect our overall defense posture the dangerous anti military sentiment discourage defense spend and unfairly disparage the man and woman who serve in our arm force the challenge that now confront this country be whether we have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term as it must be continue we can no long afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter indeed we have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budget and to examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation i be the first recent president able to address long term basic issue without the burden of vietnam the war in indochina consume enormous resource at the very time that the overwhelm strategic superiority we once enjoy be disappear in past year as a result of decision by the unite state our strategic force level off yet the soviet union continue a steady constant buildup of its own force commit a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense the unite state can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against us or even a situation where the american people or our ally believe the balance be shift against us the unite state would risk the much serious political consequence if the world come to believe that our adversary have a decisive margin of superiority to maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the s and beyond the sophistication of modern weapon require that we make decision now if we be to ensure our security year from now therefore i have consistently advocate and strongly urge that we pursue three critical strategic program the trident missile launch submarine the b bomber with its superior capability to penetrate modern air defense and a much advance intercontinental ballistic missile that will be good able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastate retaliatory strike in a era where the strategic nuclear force be in rough equilibrium the risk of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow much perilous a major long term objective therefore be to maintain capability to deal with and thereby deter conventional challenge and crisis particularly in europe we cannot rely solely on strategic force to guarantee our security or to deter all type of aggression we must have superior naval and marine force to maintain freedom of the sea strong multipurpose tactical air force and mobile modern grind force accordingly i have direct a long term effort to improve our worldwide capability to deal with regional crisis i have submit a year naval build program indispensable to the nation's maritime strategy because the security of europe and the integrity of nato remain the cornerstone of american defense policy i have initiate a special long term program to ensure the capacity of the alliance to deter or defeat aggression in europe as i leave office i can report that our national defense be effectively deter conflict today our arm force be capable of carry out the variety of mission assign to them program be underway which will assure we can deter war in the year ahead but i also must warn that it will require a sustain effort over a period of year to maintain this capability we must have the wisdom the stamen and the courage to prepare today for the peril of tomorrow and i believe we will as i look to the future and i assure you i intend to go on do that for a good many year i can say with confidence that the state of the union be good but we must go on make it good and good this gather symbolize the constitutional foundation which make continue progress possible synchronize the skill of three independent branch of government reserve fundamental sovereignty to the people of this great land it be only as the temporary representative and servant of the people that we meet here we bring no hereditary status or gift of infallibility and none follow us from this place like

honor and privilege in this world from the opportunity which fate and my fellow citizen have give me as a member of the house as vice president and president of the senate and as president of all the people i have come to understand and place the high value on the check and balance which our founder impose on government through the separation of power among co equal legislative executive and judicial branch this often result in difficulty and delay as i good know but it also place supreme authority under god beyond any one person any one branch any majority great or small or any one party the constitution be the bedrock of all our freedom guard and cherish it keep honor and order in your own house and the republic will endure it be not easy to end this remark in this chamber along with

to fulfill one of that duty of the constitution to give to the congress and to the nation information on the state of the union militarily politically economically and in spirit the state of our union be sound we be a great country a strong country a vital and a dynamic country and so we will remain we be a confident people and a hardworking people a decent and a compassionate people and so we will remain i want to speak to you tonight about where we be and where we must go about what we have do and what we must do and i want to pledge to you my good effort and ask you to pledge yours each generation of american have to face circumstance not of its own choose but by which its character be measure and its spirit be test there be time of emergency when a nation and its leader must bring their energy to bear on a single urgent task that be the duty abraham lincoln face when our land be tear apart by conflict in the war between the state that be the duty face by franklin roosevelt when he lead america out of a economic depression and again when he lead america to victory in war there be other time when there be no single overwhelm crisis yet profound national interest be at stake at such time the risk of inaction can be equally great it become the task of leader to call forth the vast and restless energy of our people to build for the future that be what harry truman do in the year after the 2 world war when we help europe and japan rebuild themselves and secure a international order that have protect freedom from aggression we live in such time now and we face such duty we've come through a long period of turmoil and doubt but we've once again find our moral course and with a new spirit we be strive to express our good instinct to the rest of the world there be all across our land a grow sense of peace and a sense of common purpose this sense of unity cannot be express in program or in legislation or in dollar it's a achievement that belong to every individual american this unity tie together and it tower over all our effort here in washington and it serve as a inspire beacon for all of us who be elect to serve this new atmosphere demand a new spirit a partnership between that of us who lead and that who elect the foundation of this partnership be truth the courage to face hard decision concern for one another and the common good over special interest and a basic faith and trust in the wisdom and strength and judgment of the american people for the first time in a generation we be not haunt by a major international crisis or by domestic turmoil and we now have a rare and a priceless opportunity to address persistent problem and burden which come to us as a nation quietly and steadily get bad over the year as president i've have to ask you the member of congress and you the american people to come to grip with some of the much difficult and hard question face our society we must make a maximum effort because if we do not aim for the good we be very likely to achieve little i see no benefit to the country if we delay because the problem will only get bad we need patience and good will but we really need to realize that there be a limit to the role and the function of government government cannot solve our problem it can't set our goal it cannot define our vision government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our city or cure illiteracy or provide energy and government cannot mandate goodness only a true partnership between government and the people can ever hope to reach this goal that of us who govern can sometimes inspire and we can identify need and marshal resource but we simply cannot be the manager of everything and everybody we here in washington must move away from crisis management and we must establish clear goal for the future immediate and the distant future which will let us work together and not in conflict never again should we neglect a grow crisis like the shortage of energy where far delay will only lead to much harsh and painful solution every day we spend much than million for foreign oil this slow our economic growth it lower the value of the dollar overseas and it aggravate unemployment and inflation here at home now we know what we must do increase production we must cut down on waste and we must use much of that fuel which be plentiful and much permanent we must be fair to people and we must not disrupt our nation's economy and our budget now that sound simple but i recognize the difficulty involve i know that it be not easy for the congress to act but the fact remain that on the energy legislation we have fail the american people almost year after the oil embargo dramatize the problem for us all we still do not have a national energy program not much long can we tolerate this stalemate it undermine our national interest both at home and abroad we must succeed and i believe we will our main task at home this year with energy a central element be the nation's economy we must continue the recovery and far cut unemployment and inflation last year be a good one for the unite state we reach all of our major economic goal for four million new job be create a all time record and the numb of unemployed drop by much than a million unemployment right now be the low it have be since and not since world war ii have such a high percentage of american people be employ the rate of inflation go down there be a good growth in business profit and investment the source of much job for our worker and a high standard of live for all our people after tax and inflation there be a healthy increase in worker wage and this year our country will have the first trillion economy in the history of the world now we be proud of this progress the first year but we must do even good in the future we still have serious problem on which all of us must work together our trade deficit be too large inflation be still too high and too many american still do not have a job now i didn't have any simple answer for all this problem but we have develop a economic policy that be work because it's simple balance and fair it's base on four principle first the economy must keep on expand to produce new job and good income which our people need the fruit of growth must be widely share much job must be make available to that who have be bypass until now and the tax system must be make fair and simple secondly private business and not the government must lead the expansion in the future 3 we must low the rate of inflation and keep it down inflation slow down economic growth and it's the much cruel to the poor and also to the elderly and other who live on fix income and 4 we must contribute to the strength of the world economy i will announce detail proposal for improve our tax system late this week we can make our tax law fair we can make them simple and easy to understand and at the same time we can and we will reduce the tax burden on american citizen by billion the tax reform and the tax reduction go together only with the long overdue reform will the full tax cut be advisable almost billion in income tax cut will go to individual ninety six percent of all american taxpayer will see their tax go down for a typical family of four this mean a annual save of much than a year or a tax reduction of about percent a far billion cut in excise tax will give much relief and also contribute directly to lower the rate of inflation and we will also provide strong additional incentive for business investment and growth through substantial cut in the corporate tax rate and improvement in the investment tax credit now this tax proposal will increase opportunity everywhere in the nation but additional job for the disadvantage deserve special attention we've already pass law to assure equal access to the vote booth and to restaurant and to school to house and law to permit access to job but job opportunity the chance to earn a decent live be also a basic human right which we cannot and will not ignore a major priority for our nation be the final elimination of the barrier that restrict the opportunity available to woman and also to black people and hispanics and other minority we've come a long way toward that goal but there be still much to do what we inherit from the past must not be permit to shackle us in the future i'll be ask you for a substantial increase in fund for public job for our young people and i also be recommend that the congress continue the public service employment program at much than twice the level of a year ago when welfare reform be complete we will have much than a million additional job so that that on welfare who be able to work can work however again we know that in our free society private business be still the good source of new job therefore i will propose a new program to encourage business to hire young and disadvantage american this young people only need skill and a chance in order to take their place in our economic system let's give them the chance they need a major step in the right direction would be the early passage of a greatly improve humphrey hawkins bill my budget for address this national need but it be lean and tight i have cut waste wherever possible i be propose a increase of little than percent after adjust for inflation the small increase in the federal budget in year lately federal spend have take a steadily increase portion of what american produce our new budget reverse that trend and late i hope to bring the government's toll down even far and with your help we'll do that in time of high employment and a strong economy deficit spend should not be a feature of our budget as the economy continue to gain strength and as our unemployment rate continue to fall revenue will grow with careful plan efficient management and proper restraint on spend we can move rapidly toward a balance budget and we will next year the budget deficit will be only slightly little than this year but one 3 of the deficit be due to the necessary tax cut that i've propose this year the right choice be to reduce the burden on taxpayer and provide much job for our people the 3 element in our program be a renew attack on inflation we've learn the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure inflation government can help us by stimulate private investment and by maintain a responsible economic policy through a new top level review process we will do a good job of reduce government regulation that drive up cost and drive up price but again government alone cannot bring down the rate of inflation when a level of high inflation be expect to continue then company raise price to protect their profit margin against prospective increase in wage and other cost while worker demand high wage as protection against expect price increase it's like a escalation in the arm race and understandably no one want to disarm alone now no one firm or a group of worker can halt this process it's a effort that we must all make together i'm therefore ask government business labor and other group to join in a voluntary program to moderate inflation by hold wage and price increase in each sector of the economy during below the average increase of the last year i do not believe in wage and price control a sincere commitment to voluntary constraint provide a way perhaps the only way to fight inflation without government interference as i come into the capitol tonight i see the farmer my fellow farmer stand out in the snow i'm familiar with their problem and i know from congress action that you be too when i be run carters warehouse we have spread on our own farm fertilizer for about a ton the last time i be home the price be about a ton the cost of nitrogen have go up percent and the price of product that farmer sell have either stay the same or go down a little now this past year in you the congress and i together pass a new agricultural act it go into effect october it'll have its first impact on the crop it will help a great deal it'll add billion or much to help the farmer with their price support and target price last year we have the high level of export of farm product in the history of our country billion we expect to have much this year we'll be work together but i think it's incumbent on us to monitor very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with the farmer of our country what's good for the farmer the farm family in the long run be also good for the consumer of our country economic success at home be also the key to success in our international economic policy a effective energy program strong investment and productivity and control inflation will provide improve our trade balance and balance it and it will help to protect the integrity of the dollar overseas by work closely with our friend abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balance agreement lower the barrier to trade despite the inevitable pressure that build up when the world economy suffer from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demand for self defeat protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i be determine to protect american industry and american worker against foreign trade practice which be unfair or illegal in a separate write message to congress i've outline other domestic initiative such as welfare reform consumer protection basic education skill urban policy reform of our labor law and national health care late on this year i will not repeat this tonight but there be several other point that i would like to make directly to you during this past year american have see our government grow far from us for some citizen the government have almost become like a foreign country so strange and distant that we've often have to deal with it through train ambassador who have sometimes become too powerful and too influential lawyer accountant and lobbyist this cannot go on we must have what abraham lincoln want a government for the people we've make progress toward that kind of government you've give me the authority i request to reorganize the federal bureaucracy and i be use that authority we've already begin a series of reorganization plan which will be complete over a period of year we have also propose abolish almost federal advisory and other commission and board but i know that the american people be still sick and tire of federal paperwork and redtape bite by bite we be chop down the thicket of unnecessary federal regulation by which government too often interfere in our personal life and our personal business we've cut the public's federal paperwork load by much than percent in little than a year and we be not through cut we've make a good start on turn the gobbledygook of federal regulation into plain english that people can understand but we know that we still have a long way to go we've bring together part of government agency to create a new department of energy and now it's time to take another major step by create a separate department of education but even the good organize government will only be as effective as the people who carry out its policy for this reason i consider civil service reform to be absolutely vital work out with the civil servant themselves this reorganization plan will restore the merit principle to a system which have grow into a bureaucratic maze it will provide great management flexibility and good reward for good performance without compromise job security then and only then can we have a government that be efficient open and truly worthy of our people's understand and respect i have promise that we will have such a government and i intend to keep that promise in our foreign policy the separation of people from government have be in the past a source of weakness and error in a democratic system like ours foreign policy decision must be able to stand the test of public examination and public debate if we make a mistake in this administration it will be on the side of frankness and openness with the american people in our modern world when the death of literally million of people can result from a few terrify second of destruction the path of national strength and security be identical to the path of peace tonight i be happy to report that because we be strong our nation be at peace with the world we be a confident nation we've restore a moral basis for our foreign policy the very heart of our identity as a nation be our firm commitment to human right we stand for human right because we believe that government have as a purpose to promote the good be of its citizen this be true in our domestic policy it's also true in our foreign policy the world must know that in support of human right the unite state will stand firm we expect no quick or easy result but there have be significant movement toward great freedom and humanity in several part of the world thousand of political prisoner have be free the leader of the world even our ideological adversary now see that their attitude toward fundamental human right affect their stand in the international community and it affect their relation with the unite state to serve the interest of every american our foreign policy have three major goal the first and prime concern be and will remain the security of our country security be base on our national will and security be base on the strength of our arm force we have the will and militarily we be very strong security also come through the strength of our alliance we have reconfirm our commitment to the defense of europe and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by far modernize and strengthen our military capability there security can also be enhance by agreement with potential adversary which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintain our own relative strategic capability in area of peaceful competition with the soviet union we will continue to much than hold our own at the same time we be negotiate with quiet confidence without haste with careful determination to ease the tension between us and to ensure great stability and security the strategic arm limitation talk have be long and difficult we want a mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear arsenal of both nation and then we want actual reduction in strategic arm as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapon from the face of the earth if this talk result in a agreement this year and i trust they will i pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the world's strategic balance and the security of the unite state for year concerted but unsuccessful effort have be make to ban the test of atomic explosive both military weapon and peaceful nuclear device we be hard at work with great britain and the soviet union on a agreement which will stop test and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance we be now make i believe good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosion we be also work vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapon among the nation of the world which do not now have them and to reduce the deadly global traffic in conventional arm sale our stand for peace be suspect if we be also the principal arm merchant of the world so we've decide to cut down our arm transfer abroad on a year by year basis and to work with other major arm exporter to encourage their similar constraint every american have a stake in our 2 major goal a world at peace in a nuclear age each of us be threaten when peace be not secure everywhere we be try to promote harmony in that part of the world where major difference exist among other nation and threaten international peace in the middle east we be contribute our good office to maintain the momentum of the current negotiation and to keep open the line of communication among the middle eastern leader the whole world have a great stake in the success of this effort this be a precious opportunity for a historic settlement of a longstanding conflict a opportunity which may never come again in our lifetime our role have be difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial but it have be constructive and it have be necessary and it will continue our 3 major foreign policy goal be one that touch the life of every american citizen every day world economic growth and stability this require strong economic performance by the industrialize democracy like ourselves and progress in resolve the global energy crisis last fall with the help of other we succeed in our vigorous effort to maintain the stability of the price of oil but as many foreign leader have emphasize to me personally and i be sure to you the great future contribution that america can make to the world economy would be a effective energy conservation program here at home we will not hesitate to take the action need to protect the integrity of the american dollar we be try to develop a much just international system and in this spirit we be support the struggle for human development in africa in asia and in latin america finally the world be watch to see how we act on one of our much important and controversial item of business approval of the panama canal treaty the treaty now before the senate be the result of the work of four administration two democratic two republican they guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use by the ship of the world our ship have the right to go to the head of the line for priority of passage in time of emergency or need we retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military force if necessary to guarantee its openness and its neutrality the treaty be to the clear advantage of ourselves the panamanian and the other user of the canal ratify the panama canal treaty will demonstrate our good faith to the world discourage the spread of hostile ideology in this hemisphere and directly contribute to the economic good be and the security of the unite state i have to say that that's very welcome applause there be two moment on my recent journey which for me confirm the final aim of our foreign policy and what it always must be one be in a little village in india where i meet a people as passionately attach to their right and liberty as we be but whose child have a far small chance for good health or food or education or human fulfillment than a child bear in this country the other moment be in warsaw capital of a nation twice devastate by war in this century there people have rebuild the city which war's destruction take from them but what be new only emphasize clearly what be lose what i see in that two place crystalized for me the purpose of our own nation's policy to ensure economic justice to advance human right to resolve conflict without violence and to proclaim in our great democracy our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human being everywhere we american have a great deal of work to do together in the end how good we do that work will depend on the spirit in which we approach it we must seek fresh answer unhindered by the stale prescription of the past it have be say that our good year be behind us but i say again that america's good be still ahead we have emerge from bitter experience chasten but proud confident once again ready to face challenge once again and unite once again we come together tonight at a solemn time last week the senate lose a good and honest man lee metcalf of montana and today the flag of the unite state fly at half mast from this capitol and from american installation and ship all over the world in mourn for senator hubert humphrey because he exemplify so good the joy and the zest of live his death remind us not so much of our own mortality but of the possibility offer to us by life he always look to the future with a special american kind of confidence of hope and enthusiasm and the good way that we can honor him be by follow his example our task to use the word of senator humphrey be reconciliation rebuild and rebirth reconciliation of private need and interest into a high purpose rebuild the old dream of justice and liberty and country and community rebirth of our faith in the common good each of us here tonight and all who be listen in your home must rededicate ourselves to serve the common good we be a community a beloved community all of us our individual fate be link our future intertwine and if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit together as the bible say we can move mountain thank you very much mr president mr speaker member of the 96th congress and my fellow citizen tonight i want to examine in a broad sense the state of our american union how we be build a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world our child who will be bear this year will come of age in the 21st century what kind of society what kind of world be we build for them will we ourselves be at peace will our child enjoy a good quality of life will a strong and unite america still be a force for freedom and prosperity around the world tonight there be every sign that the state of our union be sound our economy offer great prosperity for much of our people than ever before real per caput income and real business profit have rise substantially in the last year farm export be set a all time record each year and farm income last year net farm income be up much than percent our liberty be secure our military defense be strong and grow strong and much importantly tonight america our beloved country be at peace our early national commitment modify and reshape by succeed generation have serve us good but the problem that we face today be different from that that confront early generation of american they be much subtle much complex and much interrelate at home we be recognize ever much clearly that government alone cannot solve this problem and abroad few of them can be solve by the unite state alone but american as a unite people work with our ally and friend have never be afraid to face problem and to solve problem either here or abroad the challenge to us be to build a new and firm foundation for the future for a sound economy for a much effective government for much political trust and for a stable peace so that the america our child inherit will be even strong and even good than it be today we cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solution which substitute myth for common sense in our economy it be a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation and recession together we build the foundation for a strong economy with low inflation without contrive either a recession with its high unemployment or unworkable mandatory government control in our government it be a myth that we must choose between compassion and competence together we build the foundation for a government that work and work for people in our relation with our potential adversary it be a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation together we build the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace together we've already begin to build the foundation for confidence in our economic system during the last year in bring our economy out of the deep recession since the s we've create new job the unemployment rate have go down percent and now we must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that have wrack our country for much than a decade that's our important domestic issue and we must do it together we know that inflation be a burden for all american but it's a disaster for the poor the sick and the old no american family should be force to choose among food warmth health care or decent house because the cost of any of this basic necessity have climb out of reach three month ago i outline to the nation a balance anti inflation program that couple responsible government restraint with responsible wage and price restraint it's base upon my knowledge that there be a much powerful force than government compulsion the force create by the cooperative effort of million of american work toward a common goal business and labor have be increasingly supportive it's imperative that we in government do our part we must stop excessive government growth and we must control government spend habit i've send to this congress a stringent but a fair budget one that since i run for president in will have cut the federal deficit in half and as a percentage of our gross national product the deficit will have drop by almost percent this congress have a good record last year and i now ask the 96th congress to continue this partnership in hold the line on excess federal spend it will not be easy but we must be strong and we must be persistent this budget be a clear message that with the help of you and the american people i be determine as president to bring inflation under control the budget provide enough spend restraint to begin unwind inflation but enough support for our country to keep american worker productive and to encourage the investment that provide new job we will continue to mobilize our nation's resource to reduce our trade deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the american dollar we've demonstrate in this restrain budget that we can build on the gain of the past year to provide additional support to educate disadvantage child to care for the elderly to provide nutrition and legal service for the poor and to strengthen the economic base of our urban community and also our rural area this year we will take our first step to develop a national health plan we must never accept a permanent group of unemployed american with no hope and no stake in build our society for that leave out of the economy because of discrimination a lack of skill or poverty we must maintain high level of train and we must continue to provide job a responsible budget be not our only weapon to control inflation we must act now to protect all american from health care cost that be rise million per hour hour a day double every year we must take control of the large contributor to that inflation skyrocket hospital cost there will be no clear test of the commitment of this congress to the anti inflation fight than the legislation that i will submit again this year to hold down inflation in hospital care over the next year my proposal will save american a total of billion of which billion will be saving to the american taxpayer in the federal budget itself the american people have wait long enough this year we must act on hospital cost containment we must also fight inflation by improvement and good enforcement of our antitrust law and by reduce government obstacle to competition in the private sector we must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our economy through deregulation of the airline industry we've increase profit cut price for all american and begin for one of the few time in the history of our nation to actually dismantle a major federal bureaucracy this year we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory process for the railroad bus and the truck industry america have the great economic system in the world let's reduce government interference and give it a chance to work i call on congress to take other anti inflation action to expand our export to protect american job threaten by unfair trade to conserve energy to increase production and to speed development of solar power and to reassess our nation's technological superiority american worker who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that i have already make to the congress to be successful we must change our attitude as good as our policy

no american have die in combat anywhere in the world and in iran nicaragua cyprus namibia and rhodesia our country be work for peaceful solution to dangerous conflict in the middle east under the much difficult circumstance we have seek to help ancient enemy lie aside deep seat difference that have produce four bitter war in our lifetime our firm commitment to israel's survival and security be root in our deep conviction and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own nation of a stable middle east to promote peace and reconciliation in the region we must retain the trust and the confidence both of israel and also of the arab nation that be sincerely search for peace i be determine as president to use the full beneficial influence of our country so that the precious opportunity for last peace between israel and egypt will not be lose the new foundation of international cooperation that we seek exclude no nation cooperation with the soviet union serve the cause of peace for in this nuclear age world peace must include peace between the super power and it must mean the control of nuclear arm ten year ago the unite state and the soviet union make the historic decision to open the strategic arm limitation talk or salt the purpose of salt then as now be not to gain a unilateral advantage for either nation but to protect the security of both nation to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arm race to preserve a stable balance of nuclear force and to demonstrate to a concern world that we be determine to help preserve the peace the first salt agreement be conclude in and since then during year of negotiation by both republican and democratic leader nearly all issue of salt ii have be resolve if the soviet union continue to negotiate in good faith a responsible salt agreement will be reach it's important that the american people understand the nature of the salt process salt ii be not base on sentiment it's base on self interest of the unite state and of the soviet union both nation share a powerful common interest in reduce the threat of a nuclear war i will sign no agreement which do not enhance our national security salt ii do not rely on trust it will be verifiable we have very sophisticate prove mean include our satellite to determine for ourselves whether or not the soviet union be meet its treaty obligation i will sign no agreement which cannot he verify the american nuclear deterrent will remain strong after salt ii for example just one of our relatively invulnerable poseidon submarine comprise little than percent of our total nuclear force of submarine aircraft and landbased missile carry enough warhead to destroy every large and medium size city in the soviet union our deterrent be overwhelm and i will sign no agreement unless our deterrent force will remain overwhelm a salt agreement of course cannot substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense nor will it end the danger of nuclear war but it will certainly reduce that danger it will strengthen our effort to ban nuclear test and to stop the spread of atomic weapon to other nation and it can begin the process of negotiate new agreement which will far limit nuclear arm the path of arm control back by a strong defense the path our nation and every president have walk for year can lead to a world of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all people may live in peace in this year nothing be much important than that the congress and the people of the unite state resolve to continue with me on that path of nuclear arm control and world peace this be paramount i've outline some of the change that have transform the world and which be continue as we meet here tonight but we in america need not fear change the value on which our nation be found individual liberty self determination the potential for human fulfillment in freedom all of this endure we find this democratic principle praise even in book smuggle out of totalitarian nation and on wallposters in land which we think be close to our influence our country have regain its special place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human right and that be a commitment that we must keep at home as good as abroad the civil right revolution free all american black and white but its full promise still remain unrealized i will continue to work with all my strength for equal opportunity for all american and for affirmative action for that who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal opportunity we remain commit to improve our labor law to good protect the right of american worker and our nation must make it clear that the legal right of woman as citizen be guarantee under the law of our land by ratify the equal right amendment as long as i'm president at home and around the world america's example and america's influence will be marshal to advance the cause of human right to establish that value two century ago a bold generation of american risk their property their position and life itself we be their heir and they be send us a message across the century the word they make so vivid be now grow faintly indistinct because they be not hear often enough they be word like justice equality unity truth sacrifice liberty faith and love this word remind us that the duty of our generation of american be to renew our nation's faith not focus just against foreign threat but against the threat of selfishness cynicism and apathy the new foundation i've discuss tonight can help us build a nation and a world where every child be nurture and can look to the future with hope where the resource now waste on war can be turn towards meet human need where all people have enough to eat a decent home and protection against disease it can help us build a nation and a world where all people be free to seek the truth and to add to human understand so that all of us may live our life in peace tonight i
