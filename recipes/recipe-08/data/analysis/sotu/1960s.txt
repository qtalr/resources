mr president mr speaker member of the 86th congress seven year ago i enter my present office with one long hold resolve override all other i be then and remain now determine that the unite state shall become a ever much potent resource for the cause of peace realize that peace cannot be for ourselves alone but for people everywhere this determination be share by the entire congress indeed by all american my purpose today be to discuss some feature of america's position both at home and in her relation to other first i point out that for us annual self examination be make a definite necessity by the fact that we now live in a divide world of uneasy equilibrium with our side commit to its own protection and against aggression by the other with both side of this divide world in possession of unbelievably destructive weapon mankind approach a state where mutual annihilation become a possibility no other fact of today's world equal this in importance it color everything we say plan and do there be demand of us vigilance determination and the dedication of whatever portion of our resource that will provide adequate security especially a real deterrent to aggression this thing we be do all this fact emphasize the importance of strive incessantly for a just peace only through the strengthen of the spiritual intellectual economic and defensive resource of the free world can we in confidence make progress toward this goal 2 we note that recent soviet deportment and pronouncement suggest the possible open of a somewhat little strain period in the relationship between the soviet union and the free world if this pronouncement be genuine there be bright hope of diminish the intensity of past rivalry and eventually of substitute persuasion for coercion whether this be to become a era of last promise remain to be test by action 3 we now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological age one that despite its capacity for human destruction have a equal capacity to make poverty and human misery obsolete if our effort be wisely direct and if our unremitting effort for dependable peace begin to attain some success we can surely become participant in create a age characterize by justice and rise level of human good be over the past year the soviet union have express a interest in measure to reduce the common peril of war while neither we nor any other free world nation can permit ourselves to be mislead by pleasant promise until they be test by performance yet we approach this apparently new opportunity with the utmost seriousness we must strive to break the calamitous cycle of frustration and crisis which if unchecked can spiral into nuclear disaster the ultimate insanity though the need for dependable agreement to assure against resort to force in settle dispute be apparent to both side yet as in other issue divide man and nation we cannot expect sudden and revolutionary result but we must find some place to begin one obvious road on which to make a useful start be in the widen of communication between our two people in this field there be both side will countless opportunity much of them good know to us all for develop mutual understand the true foundation of peace another avenue may be through the reopen on january 12 of negotiation look to a control ban on the test of nuclear weapon unfortunately the close statement from the soviet scientist who meet with our scientist at geneva in a unsuccessful effort to develop a agree basis for a test ban give the clear impression that their conclusion have be politically guide that of the british and american scientific representative be their own freely form individual and collective opinion i be hopeful that as new negotiation begin truth not political opportunism will be the guide light of the deliberation still another avenue may be find in the field of disarmament in which the soviet have profess a readiness to negotiate seriously they have not however make clear the plan they may have if any for mutual inspection and verification the essential condition for any extensive measure of disarmament there be one instance where our initiative for peace have recently be successful a multi lateral treaty sign last month provide for the exclusively peaceful use of antarctica assure by a system of inspection it provide for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent and prohibit nuclear explosion there pend general international agreement on the subject the treaty be a significant contribution toward peace international cooperation and the advancement of science i shall transmit its text to the senate for consideration and approval in the near future the unite state be always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of this or any other subject that may lead to peace with justice certainly it be not necessary to repeat that the unite state have no intention of interfere in the internal affair of any nation likewise we reject any attempt to impose its system on us or on other people by force or subversion this concern for the freedom of other people be the intellectual and spiritual cement which have ally us with much than forty other nation in a common defense effort not for a moment do we forget that our own fate be firmly fasten to that of this country we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitment to them we and our friend be of course concern with self defense grow out of this concern be the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerge nation this people desperately hope to lift themselves to decent level of live must not by our neglect be force to seek help from and finally become virtual satellite of that who proclaim their hostility to freedom their natural desire for a good life must not be frustrate by withhold from them necessary technical and investment assistance this be a problem to be solve not by america alone but also by every nation cherish the same ideal and in position to provide help in recent year america's partner and friend in western europe and japan have make great economic progress their newly find economic strength be eloquent testimony to the strike success of the policy of economic cooperation which we and they have pursue the international economy of be markedly different from that of the early postwar year no long be the unite state the only major industrial country capable of provide substantial amount of the resource so urgently need in the newly develop country to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nation must extend the kind of cooperation to the little fortunate member that will inspire hope confidence and progress a rich nation can for a time without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self indulgence make its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizen thus repudiate its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nation but the enmity it will incur the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral and physical softness that will be engender will in the long term bring it to disaster america do not become great through softness and self indulgence her miraculous progress and achievement flow from other quality far much worthy and substantial adherence to principle and method consonant with our religious philosophy a satisfaction in hard work the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile cause the courage to meet every challenge to her progress the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own good interest to us and to every nation of the free world rich or poor this quality be necessary today as never before if we be to march together to great security prosperity and peace i believe the industrial country be ready to participate actively in supplement the effort of the develop country to achieve progress the immediate need for this kind of cooperation be underscore by the strain in our international balance of payment our surplus from foreign business transaction have in recent year fall substantially short of the expenditure we make abroad to maintain our military establishment overseas to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the little develop nation in our deficit in balance of payment approach billion continue deficit of anything like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world we must meet this situation by promote a rise volume of export and world trade far we must induce all industrialize nation of the free world to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the scourge of poverty from little fortunate nation this will provide for good share of this burden and for still far profitable trade new nation and other struggle with the problem of development will progress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess the will and use their own resource to fulfill it moreover progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earn there be no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane but just as we draw on europe for assistance in our early year so now do that new and emerge nation that have this faith and determination deserve help over the last fifteen year twenty nation have gain political independence other be do so each year much of them be woefully lack in technical capacity and in investment capital without free world support in this matter they cannot effectively progress in freedom respect their need one of the major focal point of our concern be the south asian region here in two nation alone be almost five hundred million people all work and work hard to raise their standard and in do so to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of a ideology that would destroy liberty i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must cooperate with other to help this people achieve their legitimate ambition as express in their different multi year plan through the world bank and other instrumentality as good as through individual action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face this titanic challenge all of us must realize of course that development in freedom by the newly emerge nation be no mere matter of obtain outside financial assistance a indispensable element in this process be a strong and continue determination on the part of this nation to exercise the national discipline necessary for any sustain development period this quality of determination be particularly essential because of the fact that the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious rather than revolutionary moreover everyone should be aware that the development process be no short term phenomenon many year be require for even the much favorably situate country i shall continue to urge the american people in the interest of their own security prosperity and peace to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully support free world decision in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom other country some of which i visit last month have similar need a common meet grind be desirable for that nation which be prepare to assist in the development effort during the past year i have discuss this matter with the leader of several western nation because of its wealth of experience the organization for european economic cooperation can help with initial study the goal be to enlist all available economic resource in the industrialize free world especially private investment capital but i repeat that this help no matter how great can be lastingly effective only if it be use as a supplement to the strength of spirit and will of the people of the newly develop nation by extend this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of this nation under freedom's banner no much startle contrast to a system of sullen satellite can be imagine if we grasp this opportunity to build a age of productive partnership between the little fortunate nation and that that have already achieve a high state of economic advancement we will make bright the outlook for a world order base upon security freedom and peace otherwise the outlook can be dark indeed we face what may be a turn point in history and we must act decisively as a nation we can successfully pursue this objective only from a position of broadly base strength no matter how earnest be our quest for guarantee peace we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we be engage in negotiate the issue of arm reduction until tangible and mutually enforceable arm reduction measure be work out we will not weaken the mean of defend our institution america possess a enormous defense power it be my study conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should be so foolish as to neglect the defense force we now so powerfully support it be world wide knowledge that any nation which may be tempt today to attack the unite state even though our country may sustain great loss would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction but i once again assure all people and all nation that the unite state except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power during the past year our long range strike power unmatched today in man bomber have take on new strength as the atla intercontinental ballistic missile have enter the operational inventory in fourteen recent test launching at range of over mile atla have be strike on a average within two mile of the target this be little than the length of a jet runway good within the circle of total destruction such performance be a great tribute to american scientist and engineer who in the past five year have have to telescope time and technology to develop this long range ballistic missile where america have none before this year moreover grow number of nuclear power submarine will enter our active force some to be arm with polaris missile this remarkable ship and weapon range the ocean will be capable of accurate fire on target virtually anywhere on earth impossible to destroy by surprise attack they will become one of our much effective sentinel for peace to meet situation of little than general nuclear war we continue to maintain our carrier force our many service unit abroad our always ready army strategic force and marine corp division and the civilian component the continue modernization of this force be a costly but necessary process and be schedule to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength the deployment of a portion of this force beyond our shore on land and sea be persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our ally for collective security moreover i have direct that step be take to program our military assistance to this ally on a long range basis this be necessary for a sound collective defense system next i refer to our effort in space exploration which be often mistakenly suppose to be a integral part of defense research and development first america have make great contribution in the past two year to the world's fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science this discovery be of present interest chiefly to the scientific community but they be important foundation stone for much extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind 2 our military missile program go forward so successfully do not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engine which be so necessary in distant space exploration i be assure by expert that the thrust of our present missile be fully adequate for defense requirement 3 the unite state be press forward in the development of large rocket engine to place much heavy vehicle into space for exploration purpose 4 in the meantime it be necessary to remember that we have only begin to probe the environment immediately surround the earth use launch system presently available we be develop satellite to scout the world's weather satellite relay station to facilitate and extend communication over the globe for navigation aid to give accurate bearing to ship and aircraft and for perfect instrument to collect and transmit the datum we seek this be the area hold the much promise for early and useful application of space technology 5 we have just complete a year's experience with our new space law i believe it deficient in certain particular and suggest improvement will be submit shortly the accomplishment of the many task i have allude to require the continuous strengthen of the spiritual intellectual and economic sinew of american life the steady purpose of our society be to assure justice before god for every individual we must be ever alert that freedom do not wither through the careless amass of restrictive control or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the giant issue of the day a year ago when i meet with you the nation be emerge from a economic downturn even though the sign of resurgent prosperity be not then sufficiently convince to the doubtful today our surge strength be apparent to everyone promise to be the much prosperous year in our history yet we continue to be afflict by nag disorder among current problem that require solution be the need to protect the public interest in situation of prolong labor management stalemate the persistent refusal to come to grip with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture the continue threat of inflation together with the persist tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility in certain instance the denial to some of our citizen of equal protection of the law every american be disturb by the prolong dispute in the steel industry and the protracted delay in reach a settlement we be all relieve that a settlement have at last be achieve in that industry percentagewise by this settlement the increase to the steel company in employment cost be low than in any prior wage settlement since world war ii it be also gratify to note that despite the increase in wage and benefit several of the major steel producer have announce that there will be no increase in steel price at this time the national interest demand that in the period of industrial peace which have be assure by the new contract both management and labor make every possible effort to increase efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of steel so that price increase can be avoid one of the lesson of this story be that the potential danger to the entire nation of long and great strike must be meet to insure against such possibility we must of course depend primarily upon the good commonsense of the responsible individual it be my intention to encourage regular discussion between management and labor outside the bargain table to consider the interest of the public as good as their mutual interest in the maintenance of industrial peace price stability and economic growth to me it seem almost absurd for the unite state to recognize the need and so earnestly to seek for cooperation among the nation unless we can achieve voluntary dependable abide cooperation among the important segment of our own free society failure to face up to basic issue in area other than that of labor management can cause serious strain on the firm freedom support of our society i refer to agriculture as one of this area our basic farm law be write year ago in a emergency effort to redress hardship cause by a world wide depression they be continue and their economic distortion intensify during world war ii in order to provide incentive for production of food need to sustain a war tear free world today our farm problem be totally different it be that of effectively adjust to the change cause by a scientific revolution when the original farm law be write a hour's farm labor produce only one 4 as much wheat as at present farm legislation be woefully out of date ineffective and expensive for year we have go on with a outmoded system which not only have fail to protect farm income but also have produce soar threaten surplus our farm have be leave produce for war while america have long be at peace once again i urge congress to enact legislation that will gear production much closely to market make costly surplus much manageable provide great freedom in farm operation and steadily achieve increase net farm income another issue that we must meet squarely be that of live within our mean this require restraint in expenditure constant reassessment of priority and the maintenance of stable price we must prevent inflation here be a opponent of so many guise that it be sometimes difficult to recognize but our clear need be to stop continuous and general price rise a need that all of us can see and feel to prevent steadily rise cost and price call for stern self discipline by every citizen no person city state or organize group can afford to evade the obligation to resist inflation for every american pay its cripple tax inflation's ravage do not end at the water's edge increase in price of the good we sell abroad threaten to drive us out of market that once be securely ours whether domestic price so high as to be noncompetitive result from demand for too high profit margin or from increase labor cost that outrun growth in productivity the final result be seriously damage to the nation we must fight inflation as we would a fire that imperil our home only by so do can we prevent it from destroy our salary saving pension and insurance and from gnaw away the very root of a free healthy economy and the nation's security one major method by which the federal government can counter inflation and rise price be to insure that its expenditure be below its revenue the debt with which we be now confront be about billion dollar with interest charge alone now cost taxpayer about billion it be clear that this debt growth must stop you will be glad to know that despite the unsettle influence of the recent steel strike we estimate that our account will show on june this year a favorable balance of approximately million i shall present to the congress for a balance budget in the area of defense expenditure continue at the record peace time level of the last several year with a single exception expenditure in every major category of health education and welfare will be equal or great than last year in space expenditure the amount be practically double but the over all guide goal of this budget be national need not response to specific group local or political insistence expenditure increase other than that i have indicate be largely account for by the increase cost of legislation previously enact i repeat this budget will be a balance one expenditure will be billion hundred million the amount of income over outgo describe in the budget as a surplus to be apply against our national debt be billion hundred million personally i do not feel that any amount can be properly call a surplus as long as the nation be in debt i prefer to think of such a item as reduction on our children's inherit mortgage once we have establish such payment as normal practice we can profitably make improvement in our tax structure and thereby truly reduce the heavy burden of taxation in any event this one reduction will save taxpayer each year approximately hundred million dollar in interest cost this budget will help ease pressure in our credit and capital market it will enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of our economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability to be fiscally responsible in the management of the huge public debt the treasury be unfortunately not free of artificial barrier its ability to deal with the difficult problem in this field have be weaken greatly by the unwillingness of the congress to remove archaic restriction the need for a free hand in debt management be even much urgent today because the cost of the undesirable finance practice which the treasury have be force into be mount removal of this roadblock have high priority in my legislative recommendation still another issue relate to civil right in all our hope and plan for a good world we all recognize that provincial and racial prejudice must be combat in the long perspective of history the right to vote have be one of the strong pillar of a free society our first duty be to protect this right against all encroachment in spite of constitutional guarantee and notwithstanding much progress of recent year bias still deprive some person in this country of equal protection of the law early in your last session i recommend legislation which would help eliminate several practice discriminate against the basic right of american the civil right commission have develop additional constructive recommendation i hope that this will be among the matter to be seriously consider in the current session i trust that congress will thus signal to the world that our government be strive for equality under law for all our people each year and in many way our nation continue to undergo profound change and growth in the past month we have hail the entry of two much state of the union alaska and hawaii we salute this two western star proudly our vigorous expansion which we all welcome as a sign of health and vitality be many side we be for example witness explosive growth in metropolitan area by the metropolitan area of the unite state will occupy twice the territory they do today the roster of urban problem with which they must cope be stagger they involve water supply clean the air adjust local tax system provide for essential educational cultural and social service and destroy that condition which breed delinquency and crime in meet this we must if we value our historic freedom keep within the traditional framework of our federal system with power divide between the national and state government the uniqueness of this system may confound the casual observer but it have work effectively for nearly year i do not doubt that our urban and other perplex problem can be solve in the traditional american method in do so we must realize that nothing be really solve and ruinous tendency be set in motion by yield to the deceptive bait of the easy federal tax dollar our educational system provide a ready example all recognize the vital necessity of have modern school plant good qualify and adequately compensate teacher and of use the good possible teach technique and curriculum we cannot be complacent about educate our youth but the route to good train mind be not through the swift administration of a federal hypodermic or sustain financial transfusion the educational process essentially a local and personal responsibility cannot be make to leap ahead by crash centralize governmental action the administration have propose a carefully reason program for help eliminate current deficiency it be design to stimulate classroom construction not by substitution of federal dollar for state and local fund but by incentive to extend and encourage state and local effort this approach reject the notion of federal domination or control it be workable and should appeal to every american interest in advancement of our educational system in the traditional american way i urge the congress to take action upon it there be one other subject concern which i renew a recommendation i make in my state of the union message last january i then advise the congress of my purpose to intensify our effort to replace force with a rule of law among nation from many discussion abroad i be convince that purpose be widely and deeply share by other people and nation of the world in the same message i state that our effort would include a reexamination of our own relation to the international court of justice the court be establish by the unite nation to decide international legal dispute between nation in we accept the court's jurisdiction but subject to a reservation of the right to determine unilaterally whether a matter lie essentially within domestic jurisdiction there be pend before the senate a resolution which would repeal our present self judge reservation i support that resolution and urge its prompt passage if this be do i intend to urge similar acceptance of the court's jurisdiction by every member of the unite nation here perhaps it be not amiss for me to say to the member of the congress in this my final year of office a word about the institution we respectively represent and the mean which the relationship between our two branch have for the day ahead i be not unique as a president in have work with a congress control by the opposition party except that no other president ever do it for quite so long yet in both personal and official relationship we have weather the storm of the past five year for this i be grateful my deep concern in the next twelve month before my successor take office be with our joint congressional executive duty to our own and to other nation act upon the belief i have express here today i shall devote my full energy to the task at hand whether this involve travel for promote great world understand negotiation to reduce international discord or constant discussion and communication with the congress and the american people on issue both domestic and foreign in pursuit of this objective i look forward to and shall dedicate myself to a close and constructive association with the congress every minute spend in irrelevant interbranch wrangle be precious time take from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policy for our national survival and progress we seek a common goal bright opportunity for our own citizen and a world peace with justice for all before us and our friend be the challenge of a ideology which for much than four decade have trumpet abroad its purpose of gain ultimate victory over all form of government at variance with its own we realize that however much we repudiate the tenet of imperialistic communism it represent a gigantic enterprise grimly pursue by leader who compel its subject to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit and personal desire for some hope for advantage in the future the communist can present a array of material accomplishment over the past fifteen year that lend a false persuasiveness to many of their glitter promise to the uncommitted people the competition they provide be formidable but in our scale of value we place freedom first our whole national existence and development have be gear to that basic concept and be responsible for the position of free world leadership to which we have succeed it be the high prize that any nation can possess it be one that communism can never offer and america's record of material accomplishment in freedom be write not only in the unparalleled prosperity of our own nation but in the many billion we have devote to the reconstruction of free world economics wreck by world war ii and in the effective help of many much billion we have give in save the independence of many other threaten by outside domination assuredly we have the capacity for handle the problem in the new era of the world's history we be now enter but we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly regardless of personal sacrifice the fissure that divide our political planet be deep and wide we live moreover in a sea of semantic disorder in which old label no long faithfully describe police state be call people's democracy arm conquest of free people be call liberation such slippery slogan make much difficult the problem of communicate true faith fact and belief we must make clear our peaceful intention our aspiration for a good world so do we must use language to enlighten the mind not as the instrument of the study innuendo and distorter of truth and we must live by what we say on my recent visit to distant land i find one statesman after another eager to tell me of the element of their government that have be borrow from our american constitution and from the indestructible ideal set forth in our declaration of independence as a nation we take pride that our own constitutional system and the ideal which sustain it have be long view as a fountainhead of freedom by our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust ever mindful that a accumulation of seemingly minor encroachment upon freedom gradually can break down the entire fabric of a free society so persuade we shall get on with the task before us so dedicate and with faith in the almighty humanity shall one day achieve the unity in freedom to which all man have aspire from the dawn of time mr speaker mr vice president member of the congress it be a pleasure to return from whence i come you be among my old friend in washington and this house be my old home it be here much than year ago that i first take the oath of federal office it be here for year that i gain both knowledge and inspiration from member of both party in both house from your wise and generous leader and from the pronouncement which i can vividly recall sit where you now sit include the program of two great president the undimmed eloquence of churchill the soar idealism of nehru the steadfast word of general de gaulle to speak from this same historic rostrum be a sober experience to be back among so many friend be a happy one i be confident that that friendship will continue our constitution wisely assign both joint and separate role to each branch of the government and a president and a congress who hold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass for my part i shall withhold from neither the congress nor the people any fact or report past present or future which be necessary for a inform judgment of our conduct and hazard i shall neither shift the burden of executive decision to the congress nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of that decision i speak today in a hour of national peril and national opportunity before my term have end we shall have to test anew whether a nation organize and govern such as ours can endure the outcome be by no mean certain the answer be by no mean clear all of us together this administration this congress this nation must forge that answer but today be i to offer after little much than a week in office detail legislation to remedy every national ill the congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed have replace the duty of responsibility my remark therefore will be limit but they will also be candid to state the fact frankly be not to despair the future nor indict the past the prudent heir take careful inventory of his legacy and give a faithful account to that whom he owe a obligation of trust and while the occasion do not call for another recital of our blessing and asset we do have no great asset than the willingness of a free and determine people through its elect official to face all problem frankly and meet all danger free from panic or fear the present state of our economy be disturb we take office in the wake of seven month of recession three and one half year of slack seven year of diminish economic growth and nine year of fall farm income business bankruptcy have reach their high level since the great depression since farm income have be squeeze down by percent save for a brief period in insure unemployment be at the high peak in our history of some five and one half million american who be without job much than one million have be search for work for much than four month and during each month some worker be exhaust their already meager jobless benefit right nearly one 8 of that who be without job live almost without hope in nearly one hundred especially depress and trouble area the rest include new school graduate unable to use their talent farmer force to give up their part time job which help balance their family budget skill and unskilled worker lay off in such important industry as metal machinery automobile and apparel our recovery from the recession moreover be anemic and incomplete our gross national product never regain its full potential unemployment never return to normal level maximum use of our national industrial capacity be never restore in short the american economy be in trouble the much resourceful industrialize country on earth rank among the last in the rate of economic growth since last spring our economic growth rate have actually recede business investment be in a decline profit have fall below predict level construction be off a million unsold automobile be in inventory few people be work and the average work week have shrink good below hour yet price have continue to rise so that now too many american have little to spend for item that cost much to buy economic prophecy be at good a uncertain art as demonstrate by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that would be and i quote the much prosperous year in our history nevertheless forecast of continue slack and only slightly reduce unemployment through and have be make with alarm unanimity and this administration do not intend to stand helplessly by we cannot afford to waste idle hour and empty plant while await the end of the recession we must show the world what a free economy can do to reduce unemployment to put unused capacity to work to spur new productivity and to foster high economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policy and relative price stability i will propose to the congress within the next day measure to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increase in duration on a self support basis to provide much food for the family of the unemployed and to aid their needy child to redevelop our area of chronic labor surplus to expand the service of the u.s employment office to stimulate house and construction to secure much purchase power for our low pay worker by raise and expand the minimum wage to offer tax incentive for sound plant investment to increase the development of our natural resource to encourage price stability and to take other step aim at insure a prompt recovery and pave the way for increase long range growth this be not a partisan program concentrate on our weakness it be i hope a national program to realize our national strength ii efficient expansion at home stimulate the new plant and technology that can make our good much competitive be also the key to the international balance of payment problem lay aside all alarmist talk and panicky solution let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective it be true that since the gap between the dollar we spend or invest abroad and the dollar return to us have substantially widen this overall deficit in our balance of payment increase by nearly billion in the year and holder of dollar abroad convert them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly billion of gold from our reserve the deficit be cause in large part by the failure of our export to penetrate foreign market the result both of restriction on our good and our own uncompetitive price the deficit on the other hand be much the result of a increase in private capital outflow seek new opportunity high return or speculative advantage abroad meanwhile this country have continue to bear much than its share of the west's military and foreign aid obligation under exist policy another deficit of billion be predict for and individual in that country whose dollar position once depend on this deficit for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserve will remain sufficient to meet our own obligation all this be cause for concern but it be not cause for panic for our monetary and financial position remain exceedingly strong include our draw right in the international monetary fund and the gold reserve hold as back for our currency and federal reserve deposit we have some billion in total gold stock and other international monetary reserve available and i now pledge that their full strength stand behind the value of the dollar for use if need moreover we hold large asset abroad the total owe this nation far exceed the claim upon our reserve and our export once again substantially exceed our import in short we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from a ounce to impose exchange control to reduce our anti recession effort to fall back on restrictive trade policy or to weaken our commitment around the world this administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion and this be a commitment prudence and good sense do require however that new step be take to ease the payment deficit and prevent any gold crisis our success in world affair have long depend in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay a series of executive order legislative remedy and cooperative effort with our ally will get underway immediately aim at attract foreign investment and travel to this country promote american export at stable price and with much liberal government guarantee and finance curb tax and custom loophole that encourage undue spend of private dollar abroad and through oecd nato and otherwise share with our ally all effort to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hope for growth of the little develop land while the current deficit last way will be find to ease our dollar outlay abroad without place the full burden on the family of man whom we have ask to serve our flag overseas in short whatever be require will be do to back up all our effort abroad and to make certain that in the future as in the past the dollar be as sound as a dollar iii but much than our exchange of international payment be out of balance the current federal budget for fiscal be almost certain to show a net deficit the budget already submit for fiscal will remain in balance only if the congress enact all the revenue measure request and only if a early and sharp up turn in the economy than my economic adviser now think likely produce the tax revenue estimate nevertheless a new administration must of necessity build on the spend and revenue estimate already submit within that framework bar the development of urgent national defense need or a worsen of the economy it be my current intention to advocate a program of expenditure which include revenue from a stimulation of the economy will not of and by themselves unbalance the early budget however we will do what must be do for our national household be clutter with unfinished and neglect task our city be be engulf in squalor twelve long year after congress declare our goal to be a decent home and a suitable environment for every american family we still have million american live in substandard home a new house program under a new house and urban affair department will be need this year our classroom contain million much child than they can properly have room for teach by teacher not properly qualify to teach one 3 of our much promise high school graduate be financially unable to continue the development of their talent the war baby of the s who overcrowd our school in the s be now descend in upon our college with two college student for every one ten year from now and our college be ill prepare we lack the scientist the engineer and the teacher our world obligation require we have neglect oceanography saline water conversion and the basic research that lie at the root of all progress federal grant for both high and public school education can no long be delay medical research have achieve new wonder but this wonder be too often beyond the reach of too many people owe to a lack of income particularly among the age a lack of hospital bed a lack of nurse home and a lack of doctor and dentist measure to provide health care for the age under social security and to increase the supply of both facility and personnel must be undertake this year our supply of clean water be dwindle organize and juvenile crime cost the taxpayer million of dollar each year make it essential that we have improve enforcement and new legislative safeguard the denial of constitutional right to some of our fellow american on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturb the national conscience and subject us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy be not equal to the high promise of our heritage morality in private business have not be sufficiently spur by morality in public business a host of problem and project in all state though not possible to include in this message deserve and will receive the attention of both the congress and the executive branch on much of this matter message will be send to the congress within the next two week iv but all this problem pale when place beside that which confront us around the world no man enter upon this office regardless of his party regardless of his previous service in washington can fail to be stagger upon learn even in this brief day period the harsh enormity of the trial through which we must pass in the next four year each day the crisis multiply each day their solution grow much difficult each day we draw near the hour of maximum danger as weapon spread and hostile force grow strong i feel i must inform the congress that our analysis over the last ten day make it clear that in each of the principal area of crisis the tide of event have be run out and time have not be our friend in asia the relentless pressure of the chinese communist menace the security of the entire area from the border of india and south viet nam to the jungle of laos struggle to protect its newly win independence we seek in laos what we seek in all asia and indeed in all of the world freedom for the people and independence for the government and this nation shall persevere in our pursuit of this objective in africa the congo have be brutally tear by civil strife political unrest and public disorder we shall continue to support the heroic effort of the unite nation to restore peace and order effort which be now endanger by mount tension unsolved problem and decrease support from many member state in latin america communist agent seek to exploit that region's peaceful revolution of hope have establish a base on cuba only mile from our shore our objection with cuba be not over the people's drive for a good life our objection be to their domination by foreign and domestic tyranny cuban social and economic reform should be encourage question of economic and trade policy can always be negotiate but communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiate we be pledge to work with our sister republic to free the americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny work toward the goal of a free hemisphere of free government extend from cape horn to the arctic circle in europe our alliance be unfulfilled and in some disarray the unity of nato have be weaken by economic rivalry and partially erode by national interest it have not yet fully mobilize its resource nor fully achieve a common outlook yet no atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problem now face us in defense foreign aid monetary reserve and a host of other area and our close tie with that whose hope and interest we share be among this nation's much powerful asset our great challenge be still the world that lie beyond the cold war but the first great obstacle be still our relation with the soviet union and communist china we must never be lull into believe that either power have yield its ambition for world domination ambition which they forcefully restate only a short time ago on the contrary our task be to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be profitable route to pursue this end open and peaceful competition for prestige for market for scientific achievement even for men's mind be something else again for if freedom and communism be to compete for man's allegiance in a world at peace i would look to the future with ever increase confidence to meet this array of challenge to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on the world scene we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tool military economic and political one must not overshadow the other on the presidential coat of arm the american eagle hold in his right talon the olive branch while in his leave he hold a bundle of arrow we intend to give equal attention to both first we must strengthen our military tool we be move into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibility require a free world force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile yet in the past lack of a consistent coherent military strategy the absence of basic assumption about our national requirement and the faulty estimate and duplication arise from inter service rivalry have all make it difficult to assess accurately how adequate or inadequate our defense really be i have therefore instruct the secretary of defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy our ability to fulfill our commitment the effectiveness vulnerability and dispersal of our strategic base force and warn system the efficiency and economy of our operation and organization the elimination of obsolete base and installation and the adequacy modernization and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear force and weapon system in the light of present and future danger i have ask for preliminary conclusion by the end of february and i then shah recommend whatever legislative budgetary or executive action be need in the light of this conclusion in the meantime i have ask the defense secretary to initiate immediately three new step much clearly need now first l have direct prompt attention to increase our air lift capacity obtain additional air transport mobility and obtain it now will good assure the ability of our conventional force to respond with discrimination and speed to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment's notice in particular it will enable us to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our force by start limit war in widely scatter part of the globe b i have direct prompt action to step up our polaris submarine program use unobligated ship build fund now to let contract originally schedule for the next fiscal year will build and place on station at less nine month early than plan substantially much unit of a crucial deterrent a fleet that will never attack first but possess sufficient power of retaliation conceal beneath the sea to discourage any aggressor from launch a attack upon our security c i have direct prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program until the secretary of defense's reappraisal be complete the emphasis here will be largely on improve organization and decision make on cut down the wasteful duplication and the time lag that have handicap our whole family of missile if we be to keep the peace we need a invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threaten a attack that he would know can not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own destruction for as i say upon take the oath of office only when our arm be sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employ secondly we must improve our economic tool our role be essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expand economy for the entire non communist world help other nation build the strength to meet their own problem to satisfy their own aspiration to surmount their own danger the problem in achieve this goal be tower and unprecedented the response must be tower and unprecedented as good much as lend lease and the marshall plan be in early year which bring such fruitful result a i intend to ask the congress for authority to establish a new and much effective program for assist the economic educational and social development of other country and continent that program must stimulate and take much effectively into account the contribution of our ally and provide central policy direction for all our own program that now so often overlap conflict or diffuse our energy and resource such a program compare to past program will require much flexibility for short run emergency much commitment to long term development new attention to education at all level great emphasis on the recipient nation's role their effort their purpose with great social justice for their people broad distribution and participation by their people and much efficient public administration and much efficient tax system of their own and orderly plan for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach i hope the senate will take early action approve the convention establish the organization for economic cooperation and development this will be a important instrument in share with our ally this development effort work toward the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay for while we be prepare to assume our full share of this huge burden we cannot and must not be expect to bear them alone to our sister republic to the south we have pledge a new alliance for progress alianza para progreso our goal be a free and prosperous latin america realize for all its state and all its citizen a degree of economic and social progress that match their historic contribution of culture intellect and liberty to start this nation's role at this time in that alliance of neighbor i be recommend the follow that the congress appropriate in full the million fund pledge by the act of bogota to be use not as a instrument of the cold war but as a first step in the sound development of the americas that a new inter departmental task force be establish under the leadership of the department of state to coordinate at the high level all policy and program of concern to the americas that our delegate to the oas work with that of other member strengthen that body as a instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the hemisphere that in cooperation with other nation we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunity to all level and finally that a food for peace mission be send immediately to latin america to explore way in which our vast food abundance can be use to help end hunger and malnutrition in certain area of suffer in our own hemisphere this administration be expand its food for peace program in every possible way the product of our abundance must be use much effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corner of the globe and i have ask the director of this program to recommend additional way in which this surplus can advance the interest of world peace include the establishment of world food reserve a even much valuable national asset be our reservoir of dedicate man and woman not only on our college campus but in every age group who have indicate their desire to contribute their skill their effort and a part of their life to the fight for world order we can mobilize this talent through the formation of a national peace corp enlist the service of all that with the desire and capacity to help foreign land meet their urgent need for train personnel finally while our attention be center on the development of the noncommunist world we must never forget our hope for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the eastern european people in order to be prepare to help re establish historic tie of friendship i be ask the congress for increase discretion to use economic tool in this area whenever this be find to be clearly in the national interest this will require amendment of the mutual defense assistance control act along the line i propose as a member of the senate and upon which the senate vote last summer meanwhile i hope to explore with the polish government the possibility of use our freeze polish fund on project of peace that will demonstrate our abide friendship for and interest in the people of poland 3 we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tool the mean of cooperation and agreement on which a enforceable world order must ultimately rest i have already take step to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort to increase our program of research and study and to make arm control a central goal of our national policy under my direction the deadly arm race and the huge resource it absorb have too long overshadow all else we must do we must prevent that arm race from spread to new nation to new nuclear power and to the reach of outer space we must make certain that our negotiator be good inform and good prepare to formulate workable proposal of our own and to make sound judgment about the proposal of other i have ask the other government concern to agree to a reasonable delay in the talk on a nuclear test ban and it be our intention to resume negotiation prepare to reach a final agreement with any nation that be equally will to agree to a effective and enforceable treaty we must increase our support of the unite nation as a instrument to end the cold war instead of a arena in which to fight it in recognition of its increase importance and the double of its membership we be enlarge and strengthen our own mission to the u.n we shall help insure that it be properly finance we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the secretary general be maintain and i would address a special plea to the small nation of the world to join with us in strengthen this organization which be far much essential to their security than it be to ours the only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure where every nation have a equal voice and where any nation can exert influence not accord to the strength of its army but accord to the strength of its idea it deserve the support of all finally this administration intend to explore promptly all possible area of cooperation with the soviet union and other nation to invoke the wonder of science instead of its terror specifically i now invite all nation include the soviet union to join with us in develop a weather prediction program in a new communication satellite program and in preparation for probe the distant planet of mar and venus probe which may someday unlock the deep secret of the universe today this country be ahead in the science and technology of space while the soviet union be ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicle into orbit both nation would help themselves as good as other nation by ten move this endeavor from the bitter and wasteful competition of the cold war the unite state would be will to join with the soviet union and the scientist of all nation in a great effort to make the fruit of this new knowledge available to all and beyond that in a effort to extend farm technology to hungry nation to wipe out disease to increase the exchange of scientist and their knowledge and to make our own laboratory available to technician of other land who lack the facility to pursue their own work where nature make natural ally of us all we can demonstrate that beneficial relation be possible even with that with whom we much deeply disagree and this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law v i have comment on the state of the domestic economy our balance of payment our federal and social budget and the state of the world i would like to conclude with a few remark about the state of the executive branch we have find it full of honest and useful public servant but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action be need have too often be muffle in the morass of committee timidity and fictitious theory which have create a grow gap between decision and execution between plan and reality in a time of rapidly deteriorate situation at home and abroad this be bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country and we mean to make a change i have pledge myself and my colleague in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative responsibility and energy in serve the public interest let every public servant know whether his post be high or low that a man's rank and reputation in this administration will be determine by the size of the job he do and not by the size of his staff his office or his budget let it be clear that this administration recognize the value of dissent and dare that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change let the public service be a proud and lively career and let every man and woman who work in any area of our national government in any branch at any level be able to say with pride and with honor in future year i serve the unite state government in that hour of our nation's need for only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can we bring our country through the trouble year that lie ahead our problem be critical the tide be unfavorable the news will be bad before it be good and while hope and work for the good we should prepare ourselves now for the bad we cannot escape our danger neither must we let them drive us into panic or narrow isolation in many area of the world where the balance of power already rest with our adversary the force of freedom be sharply divide it be one of the irony of our time that the technique of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor in its servant while the blessing of liberty have too often stand for privilege materialism and a life of case but i have a different view of liberty life in will not be easy wish it predict it even ask for it will not make it so there will be far setback before the tide be turn but turn it we must the hope of all mankind rest upon us not simply upon that of us in this chamber but upon the peasant in laos the fisherman in nigeria the exile from cuba the spirit that move every man and nation who share our hope for freedom and the future and in the final analysis they rest much of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizen of the great republic in the word of a great president whose birthday we honor today close his final state of the union message sixteen year ago we pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunity that god have give us mr vice president my old colleague from massachusetts and your new speaker john mccormack member of the 87th congress lady and gentleman this week we begin anew our joint and separate effort to build the american future but sadly we build without a man who link a long past with the present and look strongly to the future mister sam rayburn be go neither this house nor the nation be the same without him member of the congress the constitution make us not rival for power but partner for progress we be all trustee for the american people custodian of the american heritage it be my task to report the state of the union to improve it be the task of us all in the past year i have travel not only across our own land but to other land to the north and the south and across the sea and i have find as i be sure you have in your travel that people everywhere in spite of occasional disappointment look to us not to our wealth or power but to the splendor of our ideal for our nation be commission by history to be either a observer of freedom's failure or the cause of its success our override obligation in the month ahead be to fulfill the world's hope by fulfill our own faith strengthen the economy that task must begin at home for if we cannot fulfill our own ideal here we cannot expect other to accept them and when the young child alive today have grow to the care of manhood our position in the world will be determine first of all by what provision we make today for his education his health and his opportunity for a good home and a good job and a good life at home we begin the year in the valley of recession we complete it on the high road of recovery and growth with the help of new congressionally approve or administratively increase stimulant to our economy the numb of major surplus labor u area have decline from to nonagricultural employment have increase by much than a million job and the average factory work week have rise to good over hour at year's end the economy which mr khrushchev once call a stumble horse be race to new record in consumer spend labor income and industrial production we be gratify but we be not satisfy too many unemployed be still look for the blessing of prosperity as that who leave our school and farm demand new job automation take old job away to expand our growth and job opportunity i urge on the congress three measure first the manpower train and development act to stop the waste of able bodied man and woman who want to work but whose only skill have be replace by a machine or move with a mill or shut down with a mine 2 the youth employment opportunity act to help train and place not only the one million young american who be both out of school and out of work but the twenty six million young american enter the labor market in this decade and 3 the percent tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment which combine with plan revision of depreciation allowance will spur our modernization our growth and our ability to compete abroad moreover pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery let us not forget that we have suffer three recession in the last year the time to repair the roof be when the sun be shine by fill three basic gap in our anti recession protection we need first presidential standby authority subject to congressional veto to adjust personal income tax rate downward within a specify range and time to slow down a economic decline before it have drag us all down 2 presidential standby authority upon a give rise in the rate of unemployment to accelerate federal and federally aid capital improvement program and 3 a permanent strengthen of our unemployment compensation system to maintain for our fellow citizen search for a job who cannot find it their purchase power and their live standard without constant resort as we have see in recent year by the congress and the administration to temporary supplement if we enact this six part program we can show the whole world that a free economy need not be a unstable economy that a free system need not leave man unemployed and that a free society be not only the much productive but the much stable form of organization yet fashion by man ii fight inflation but recession be only one enemy of a free economy inflation be another last year despite rise production and demand consumer price hold almost steady and wholesale price decline this be the good record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of world war ii inflation too often follow in the shadow of growth while price stability be make easy by stagnation or control but we mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom our first line of defense against inflation be the good sense and public spirit of business and labor keep their total increase in wage and profit in step with productivity there be no single statistical test to guide each company and each union but i strongly urge them for their country's interest and for their own to apply the test of the public interest to this transaction within this same framework of growth and wage price stability this administration have help keep our economy competitive by widen the access of small business to credit and government contract and by step up the drive against monopoly price fix and racketeering we will submit a federal pay reform bill aim at give our classify postal and other employee new pay scale much comparable to that of private industry we be hold the fiscal budget deficit far below the level incur after the last recession in and finally i be submit for fiscal a balance federal budget this be a joint responsibility require congressional cooperation on appropriation and on three source of income in particular first a increase in postal rate to end the postal deficit secondly passage of the tax reform previously urge to remove unwarranted tax preference and to apply to dividend and to interest the same withhold requirement we have long apply to wage and 3 extension of the present excise and corporation tax rate except for that change which will be recommend in a message affect transportation iii get america move but a strong nation and economy require much than a balance budget they require progress in that program that spur our growth and fortify our strength city a strong america depend on its city america's glory and sometimes america's shame to substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay we have step up exist urban renewal and house program and launch new one redouble the attack on water pollution speed aid to airport hospital highway and our decline mass transit system and secure new weapon to combat organize crime racketeering and youth delinquency assist by the coordinate and hard hit effort of our investigative service the fbi the internal revenue the bureau of narcotic and many other we shall need far anti crime mass transit and transportation legislation and new tool to fight air pollution and with all this effort under way both equity and commonsense require that our nation's urban area contain three fourth of our population sit as equal at the cabinet table i urge a new department of urban affair and house agriculture and resource a strong america also depend on its farm and natural resource american farmer take heart in from a billion dollar rise in farm income and from a hopeful start on reduce the farm surplus but we be still operate under a patchwork accumulation of old law which cost us billion a year in ccc carry charge alone yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings our task be to master and turn to fully fruitful end the magnificent productivity of our farm and farmer the revolution on our own countryside stand in the sharp contrast to the repeat farm failure of the communist nation and be a source of pride to us all since our agricultural output per man hour have actually double without new realistic measure it will someday swamp our farmer and our taxpayer in a national scandal or a farm depression i will therefore submit to the congress a new comprehensive farm program tailor to fit the use of our land and the supply of each crop to the long range need of the sixty and design to prevent chaos in the sixty with a program of commonsense we also need for the sixty if we be to bequeath our full national estate to our heir a new long range conservation and recreation program expansion of our superb national park and forest preservation of our authentic wilderness area new start on water and power project as our population steadily increase and expand rea generation and transmission loan civil right but america stand for progress in human right as good as economic affair and a strong america require the assurance of full and equal right to all its citizen of any race or of any color this administration have show as never before how much can be do through the full use of executive power through the enforcement of law already pass by the congress through persuasion negotiation and litigation to secure the constitutional right of all the right to vote the right to travel without hindrance across state line and the right to free public education i issue last march a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all federal agency and contractor the vice president's committee thus create have do much include the voluntary plan for progress which in all section of the country be achieve a quiet but strike success in open up to all race new professional supervisory and other job opportunity but there be much much to be do by the executive by the court and by the congress among the bill now pend before you on which the executive department will comment in detail be appropriate method of strengthen this basic right which have our full support the right to vote for example should no long be deny through such arbitrary device on a local level sometimes abuse such as literacy test and poll tax as we approach the 100th anniversary next january of the emancipation proclamation let the act of every branch of the government and every citizen portray that righteousness do exalt a nation health and welfare finally a strong america cannot neglect the aspiration of its citizen the welfare of the needy the health care of the elderly the education of the young for we be not develop the nation's wealth for its own sake wealth be the mean and people arc the end all our material rich will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the opportunity of our people last year we improve the diet of needy people provide much hot lunch and fresh milk to school child build much college dormitory and for the elderly expand private house nurse home heath service and social security but we have just begin to help that less fortunate of all i be recommend a new public welfare program stress service instead of support rehabilitation instead of relief and train for useful work instead of prolong dependency to relieve the critical shortage of doctor and dentist and this be a matter which should concern us all and expand research i urge action to aid medical and dental college and scholarship and to establish new national institute of health to take advantage of modern vaccination achievement i be propose a mass immunization program aim at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemy of our child as polio diphtheria whoop cough and tetanus to protect our consumer from the careless and the unscrupulous i shall recommend improvement in the food and drug law strengthen inspection and standard halt unsafe and worthless product prevent mislead label and crack down on the illicit sale of habit form drug but in matter of health no piece of unfinished business be much important or much urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the age for our old citizen have long and much frequent illness high hospital and medical bill and too little income to pay them private health insurance help very few for its cost be high and its coverage limit public welfare cannot help that too proud to seek relief but hard press to pay their own bill nor can their child or grandchild always sacrifice their own health budget to meet this constant drain social security have long help to meet the hardship of retirement death and disability i now urge that its coverage be extend without far delay to provide health insurance for the elderly education equally important to our strength be the quality of our education eight million adult american be classify as functionally illiterate this be a disturb figure reflect in selective service rejection rate reflect in welfare roll and crime rate and i shall recommend plan for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy i shall also recommend bill to improve educational quality to stimulate the art and at the college level to provide federal loan for the construction of academic facility and federally finance scholarship if this nation be to grow in wisdom and strength then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talent yet nearly half lack either the fund or the facility to attend college enrollment be go to double in our college in the short space of year the annual cost per student be skyrocket to astronomical level now average a year although almost half of our family earn little than they cannot afford such cost but this nation cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower but excellence in education must begin at the elementary level i send to the congress last year a proposal for federal aid to public school construction and teacher salary i believe that bill which pass the senate and receive house committee approval offer the minimum amount require by our need and in term of across the board aid the maximum scope permit by our constitution i therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill and i urge its passage at this session civilization say h g well be a race between education and catastrophe it be up to you in this congress to determine the winner of that race this be not unrelated measure address to specific gap or grievance in our national life they be the pattern of our intention and the foundation of our hope i believe in democracy say woodrow wilson because it release the energy of every human be the dynamic of democracy be the power and the purpose of the individual and the policy of this administration be to give to the individual the opportunity to realize his own high possibility our program be to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion to offer to all the facility for education and health and welfare to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress and thus to realize for all the full promise of american life iv our goal abroad all of this effort at home give mean to our effort abroad since the close of the 2 world war a global civil war have divide and torment mankind but it be not our military may or our high standard of live that have much distinguish us from our adversary it be our belief that the state be the servant of the citizen and not his master this basic clash of idea and will be but one of the force reshape our globe sweep as it be by the tide of hope and fear by crisis in the headline today that become mere footnote tomorrow both the success and the setback of the past year remain on our agendum of unfinished business for every apparent bless contain the seed of danger every area of trouble give out a ray of hope and the one unchangeable certainty be that nothing be certain or unchangeable yet our basic goal remain the same a peaceful world community of free and independent state free to choose their own future and their own system so long as it do not threaten the freedom of other some may choose form and way that we would not choose for ourselves but it be not for us that they be choose we can welcome diversity the communist cannot for we offer a world of choice they offer the world of coercion and the way of the past show dearly that freedom not coercion be the wave of the future at time our goal have be obscure by crisis or endanger by conflict but it draw sustenance from five basic source of strength the moral and physical strength of the unite state the unite strength of the atlantic community the regional strength of our hemispheric relation the creative strength of our effort in the new and develop nation and the peace keep strength of the unite nation v our military strength our moral and physical strength begin at home as already discuss but it include our military strength as good so long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affair of man we must arm to deter other from aggression in the past month our military posture have steadily improve we increase the previous defense budget by percent not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace we much than double our acquisition rate of polaris submarine we double the production capacity for minuteman missile and increase by percent the numb of man bomber stand ready on a minute alert this year the combine force level plan under our new defense budget include nearly three hundred additional polaris and minuteman missile have be precisely calculate to insure the continue strength of our nuclear deterrent but our strength may be test at many level we intend to have at all time the capacity to resist non nuclear or limit attack as a complement to our nuclear capacity not as a substitute we have reject any all or nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation thus we have double the numb of ready combat division in the army's strategic reserve increase our troop in europe build up the marine add new sealift and airlift capacity modernize our weapon and ammunition expand our anti guerrilla force and increase the active fleet by much than vessel and our tactical air force by nearly a dozen wing because we need to reach this high long term level of readiness much quickly member of the reserve and national guard be activate under the act of this congress some disruption and distress be inevitable but the overwhelm majority bear their burden and their nation's burden with admirable and traditional devotion in the come year our reserve program will be revise two army division will i hope replace that guard division on duty and substantial other increase will boost our air force fighter unit the procurement of equipment and our continental defense and warn effort the nation's first serious civil defense shelter program be under way identify mark and stock million space and i urge your approval of federal incentive for the construction of public fall out shelter in school and hospital and similar center vi the unite nation but arm alone be not enough to keep the peace it must be keep by man our instrument and our hope be the unite nation and i see little merit in the impatience of that who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world for the trouble of a world organization merely reflect the trouble of the world itself and if the organization be weaken this trouble can only increase we may not always agree with every detail action take by every officer of the unite nation or with every vote majority but as a institution it should have in the future as it have have in the past since its inception no strong or much faithful member than the unite state of america in the peace keep strength of the unite nation be reinforce and that who prefer or predict its demise envision a troika in the seat of hammarskiold or red china inside the assembly have see instead a new vigor under a new secretary general and a fully independent secretariat in make plan for a new forum and principle on disarmament for peace keep in outer space for a decade of development effort the un fulfill its charter's lofty aim eighteen month ago the tangle and turbulent congo present the un with its grave challenge the prospect be one of chaos or certain big power confrontation with all of its hazard and all of its risk to us and to other today the hope have improve for peaceful conciliation within a unite congo this be the objective of our policy in this important area no policeman be universally popular particularly when he use his stick to restore law and order on his beat that member who be will to contribute their vote and their view but very little else have create a serious deficit by refuse to pay their share of special un assessment yet they do pay their annual assessment to retain their vote and a new un bond issue finance special operation for the next month be to be repay with interest from this regular assessment this be clearly in our interest it will not only keep the un solvent but require all vote member to pay their fair share of its activity our share of special operation have long be much high than our share of the annual assessment and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation and for this reason i be urge congress to approve our participation with the approval of this congress we have undertake in the past year a great new effort in outer space our aim be not simply to be first on the moon any much than charles lindbergh's real aim be to be the first to paris his aim be to develop the technique of our own country and other country in the field of air and the atmosphere and our objective in make this effort which we hope will place one of our citizen on the moon be to develop in a new frontier of science commerce and cooperation the position of the unite state and the free world this nation belong among the first to explore it and among the first if not the first we shall be we be offer our know how and our cooperation to the unite nation our satellite will soon be provide other nation with improve weather observation and i shall soon send to the congress a measure to govern the finance and operation of a international communication satellite system in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy but peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth be go world order will be secure only when the whole world have lay down this weapon which seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival of the human race that armistice day seem very far away the vast resource of this planet be be devote much and much to the mean of destroy instead of enrich human life but the world be not mean to be a prison in which man await his execution nor have mankind survive the test and trial of thousand of year to surrender everything include its existence now this nation have the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear test and we will persist until we prevail until the rule of law have replace the ever dangerous use of force vii latin america i turn now to a prospect of great promise our hemispheric relation the

worker and farmer as good as diplomat we have pledge our help in speed their economic educational and social progress the latin american republic have in turn pledge a new and strenuous effort of self help and self reform to support this historic undertake i be propose under the authority contain in the bill of the last session of the congress a special long term alliance for progress fund of billion combine with our food for peace export import bank and other resource this will provide much than billion a year in new support for the alliance in addition we have increase twelve fold our spanish and portuguese language broadcast in latin america and improve hemispheric trade and defense and while the blight of communism have be increasingly expose and isolate in the americas liberty have score a gain the people of the dominican republic with our firm encouragement and help and that of our sister republic of this hemisphere be safely pass through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy viii the new and develop nation our effort to help other new or develop nation and to strengthen their stand for freedom have also make progress a newly unify agency for international development be reorient our foreign assistance to emphasize long term development loan instead of grant much economic aid instead of military individual plan to meet the individual need of the nation and new standard on what they must do to marshal their own resource a newly conceive peace corp be win friend and help people in fourteen country supply train and dedicate young man and woman to give this new nation a hand in build a society and a glimpse of the good that be in our country if there be a problem here it be that we cannot supply the spontaneous and mount demand a newly expand food for peace pro gram be feed the hungry of many land with the abundance of our productive farm provide lunch for child in school wage for economic development relief for the victim of flood and famine and a good diet for million whose daily bread be their chief concern this program help people and by help people they help freedom the view of their government may sometimes be very different from ours but event in africa the middle east and eastern europe teach us never to write off any nation as lose to the communist that be the lesson of our time we support the independence of that new or weak state whose history geography economy or lack of power impel them to remain outside entangle alliance as we do for much than a century for the independence of nation be a bar to the communist grand design it be the basis of our own in the past year for example we have urge a neutral and independent laos regain there a common policy with our major ally and insist that a cease fire precede negotiation while a workable formula for supervise its independence be still to be achieve both the spread of war which may have involve this country also and a communist occupation have thus far be prevent a satisfactory settlement in laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in viet nam where the foe be increase his tactic of terror where our own effort have be step up and where the local government have initiate new program and reform to broaden the base of resistance the systematic aggression now bleed that country be not a war of liberation for viet nam be already free it be a war of attempt subjugation and it will be resist ix the atlantic community finally the unite strength of the atlantic community have flourish in the last year under severe test nato have increase both the numb and the readiness of its air grind and naval unit both its nuclear and non nuclear capability even great effort by all its member be still require nevertheless our unity of purpose and will have be i believe immeasurably strengthen the threat to the brave city of berlin remain in this last month the ally have make it unmistakably clear that our presence in berlin our free access thereto and the freedom of two million west berliners would not be surrender either to force or through appeasement and to maintain that right and obligation we be prepare to talk when appropriate and to fight if necessary every member of nato stand with us in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free i cannot now predict the course of future negotiation over berlin i can only say that we be spare no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem i believe such a resolution can be find and with it a improvement in our relation with the soviet union if only the leader in the kremlin will recognize the basic right and interest involve and the interest of all mankind in peace but the atlantic community be no long concern with purely military aim as its common undertaking grow at a ever increase pace we be and increasingly will be partner in aid trade defense diplomacy and monetary affair the emergence of the new europe be be match by the emergence of new tie across the atlantic it be a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundred of workaday task of currency keep in effective relation of development loan mesh together of standardize weapon and concerted diplomatic position the atlantic community grow not like a volcanic mountain by one mighty explosion but like a coral reef from the accumulate activity of all thus we in the free world be move steadily toward unity and cooperation in the tooth of that old bolshevik prophecy and at the very time when extraordinary rumble of discord can be hear across the iron curtain it be not free society which bear within them the seed of inevitable disunity x our balance of payment on one special problem of great concern to our friend and to us i be proud to give the congress a encourage report our effort to safeguard the dollar be progress in the month precede last february we suffer a net loss of nearly billion in gold in the month that follow the loss be just over half a billion dollar and our deficit in our basic transaction with the rest of the world trade defense foreign aid and capital exclude volatile short term flow have be reduce from billion for to about one 3 that amount for speculative fever against the dollar be end and confidence in the dollar have be restore we do not and can not achieve this gain through import restriction troop withdrawal exchange control dollar devaluation or choke off domestic recovery we act not in panic but in perspective but the problem be not yet solve persistently large deficit would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense commitment abroad our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payment with the cooperation of the congress business labor and our major ally that goal can be reach we shall continue to attract foreign tourist and investment to our shore to seek increase military purchase here by our ally to maximize foreign aid procurement from american firm to urge increase aid from other fortunate nation to the little fortunate to seek tax law which do not favor investment in other industrialize nation or tax haven and to urge coordination of ally fiscal and monetary policy so as to discourage large and disturb capital movement trade above all if we be to pay for our commitment abroad we must expand our export our businessman must be export conscious and export competitive our tax policy must spur modernization of our plant our wage and price gain must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on price our export credit and promotion campaign for american industry must continue to expand but the great challenge of all be pose by the growth of the european common market assume the accession of the unite kingdom there will arise across the atlantic a trade partner behind a single external tariff similar to ours with a economy which nearly equal our own will we in this country adapt our think to this new prospect and pattern or will we wait until event have pass us by this be the year to decide the reciprocal trade act be expire we need a new law a wholly new approach a bold new instrument of american trade policy our decision can good affect the unity of the west the course of the cold war and the economic growth of our nation for a generation to come if we move decisively our factory and farm can increase their sale to their rich fast grow market our export will increase our balance of payment position will improve and we will have forge across the atlantic a trade partnership with vast resource for freedom if on the other hand we hang back in deference to local economic pressure we will find ourselves cut off from our major ally industry and i believe this be much vital industry will move their plant and job and capital inside the wall of the common market and job therefore will be lose here in the unite state if they cannot otherwise compete for its consumer our farm surplus our balance of trade as you all know to europe the common market in farm product be nearly three or four to one in our favor amount to one of the good earner of dollar in our balance of payment structure and without entrance to this market without the ability to enter it our farm surplus will pile up in the middle west tobacco in the south and other commodity which have go through western europe for year our balance of payment position will worsen our consumer will lack a wide choice of good at low price and million of american worker whose job depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of export or import or whose job will be endanger by the movement of our capital to europe or whose job can be maintain only in a expand economy this million of worker in your home state and mine will see their real interest sacrifice member of the congress the unite state do not rise to greatness by wait for other to lead this nation be the world's foremost manufacturer farmer banker consumer and exporter the common market be move ahead at a economic growth rate twice ours the communist economic offensive be under way the opportunity be ours the initiative be up to us and i believe that be the time to seize that initiative i shall shortly send to the congress a new five year trade expansion action far reach in scope but design with great care to make certain that its benefit to our people far outweigh any risk the bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariff here in the unite state and in the common market on that item in which we together supply percent of the world's trade mostly item in which our own ability to compete be demonstrate by the fact that we sell abroad in this item substantially much than we import this step will make it possible for our major industry to compete with their counterpart in western europe for access to european consumer on other good the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duty up to percent permit bargain by major category and provide for appropriate and test form of assistance to firm and employee adjust to import competition we be not neglect the safeguard provide by peril point a escape clause or the national security amendment nor be we abandon our non european friend or our traditional much favor nation principle on the contrary the bill will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural product so important to our friend in latin america who have long depend upon the european market who now find themselves face with new challenge which we must join with them in overcome concession in this bargain must of course be reciprocal not unilateral the common market will not fulfill its own high promise unless its outside tariff wall be low the danger of restriction or timidity in our own policy have counterpart for our friend in europe for together we face a common challenge to enlarge the prosperity of free man everywhere to build in partnership a new trade community in which all free nation may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort this various element in our foreign policy lead as i have say to a single goal the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent state this be our guide for the present and our vision for the future a free community of nation independent but interdependent unite north and south east and west in one great family of man outgrow and transcend the hate and fear that rend our age we will not reach that goal today or tomorrow we may not reach it in our own lifetime but the quest be the great adventure of our century we sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligation the complexity of our decision the agony of our choice but there be no comfort or security for us in evasion no solution in abdication no relief in irresponsibility a year ago in assume the task of the presidency i say that few generation in all history have be grant the role of be the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger this be our good fortune and i welcome it now as i do a year ago for it be the fate of this generation of you in the congress and of me as president to live with a struggle we do not start in a world we do not make but the pressure of life be not always distribute by choice and while no nation have ever face such a challenge no nation have ever be so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom and in this high endeavor may god watch over the unite state of america mr vice president mr speaker member of the 88th congress i congratulate you all not merely on your electoral victory but on your select role in history for you and i be privilege to serve the great republic in what can be the much decisive decade in its long history the choice we make for good or ill may good shape the state of the union for generation yet to come little much than week ago i assume the office of president of the unite state in seek the help of the congress and our countryman i pledge no easy answer i pledge and ask only toil and dedication this the congress and the people have give in good measure and today have witness in recent month a heighten respect for our national purpose and power have see the courageous calm of a unite people in a perilous hour and have observe a steady improvement in the opportunity and good be of our citizen i can report to you that the state of this old but youthful union in the 175th year of its life be good in the world beyond our border steady progress have be make in build a world of order the people of west berlin remain both free and secure a settlement though still precarious have be reach in laos the spearpoint of aggression have be blunt in viet nam the end of agony may be in sight in the congo the doctrine of troika be dead and while danger continue a deadly threat have be remove in cuba at home the recession be behind us good over a million much man and woman be work today than be work year ago the average factory workweek be once again much than hour our industry be turn out much good than ever before and much than half of the manufacture capacity that lie silent and waste week ago be hum with activity in short both at home and abroad there may now be a temptation to relax for the road have be long the burden heavy and the pace consistently urgent but we cannot be satisfy to rest here this be the side of the hill not the top the mere absence of war be not peace the mere absence of recession be not growth we have make a begin but we have only begin now the time have come to make the much of our gain to translate the renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national purpose ii america have enjoy month of uninterrupted economic recovery but recovery be not enough if we be to prevail in the long run we must expand the long run strength of our economy we must move along the path to a high rate of growth and full employment for this would mean ten of billion of dollar much each year in production profit wage and public revenue it would mean a end to the persistent slack which have keep our unemployment at or above percent for out of the past month and a end to the grow pressure for such restrictive measure as the hour week which alone can increase hourly labor cost by as much as percent start a new wage price spiral of inflation and undercut our effort to compete with other nation to achieve this great gain one step above all be essential the enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in federal income tax for it be increasingly clear to that in government business and labor who be responsible for our economy's success that our obsolete tax system exert too heavy a drag on private purchase power profit and employment design to check inflation in early year it now check growth instead it discourage extra effort and risk it distort the use of resource it invite recurrent recession depress our federal revenue and cause chronic budget deficit now when the inflationary pressure of the war and the post war year no long threaten and the dollar command new respect now when no military crisis strain our resource now be the time to act we cannot afford to be timid or slow for this be the much urgent task confront the congress in in a early message i shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rate which will low liability by billion of this billion result from reduce individual tax rate which now range between and percent to a much sensible range of to percent with a split in the present first bracket two and one half billion dollar result from reduce corporate tax rate from percent which give the government today a majority interest in profit to the permanent pre korean level of percent this be in addition to the much than billion cut in corporate tax liability result from last year's investment credit and depreciation reform to achieve this reduction within the limit of a manageable budgetary deficit i urge first that this cut be phase over calendar year begin in with a cut of some billion at annual rate 2 that this reduction be couple with select structural change begin in which will broaden the tax base end unfair or unnecessary preference remove or lighten certain hardship and in the net offset some billion of the revenue loss and 3 that budgetary receipt at the outset be increase by billion a year without any change in tax liability by gradually shift the tax payment of large corporation to a much current time schedule this combine program by increase the amount of our national income will in time result in still high federal revenue it be a fiscally responsible program the sure and the sound way of achieve in time a balance budget in a balance full employment economy this net reduction in tax liability of billion will increase the purchase power of american family and business enterprise in every tax bracket with great increase go to our low income consumer it will in addition encourage the initiative and risk take on which our free system depend induce much investment production and capacity use help provide the million new job we need every year and reinforce the american principle of additional reward for additional effort i do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform be the only way to achieve this goal no doubt a massive increase in federal spend can also create job and growth but in today's set private consumer employer and investor should be give a full opportunity first no doubt a temporary tax cut can provide a spur to our economy but a long run problem compel a long run solution no doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation tax alone would be of great help but corporation need customer and job seeker need job no doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simple and much attractive to many but our growth be also hamper by a host of tax inequity and special preference which have distort the flow of investment and finally there be no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately a end to the cold war would make possible a equivalent cut in expenditure but that end be not in view and to wait for it would be costly and self defeat in submit a tax program which will of course temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end it and in recognition of the need to control expenditure i will shortly submit a fiscal administrative budget which while allow for need rise in defense space and fix interest charge hold total expenditure for all other purpose below this year's level this require the reduction or postponement of many desirable program the absorption of a large part of last year's federal pay raise through personnel and other economy the termination of certain installation and project and the substitution in several program of private for public credit but i be convince that the enactment this year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadow all other domestic problem in this congress for we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom if we ever cease to set the pace here at home iii tax reduction alone however be not enough to strengthen our society to provide opportunity for the four million american who be bear every year to improve the life of million american who live on the outskirts of poverty the quality of american life must keep pace with the quantity of american good this country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor therefore by hold down the budgetary cost of exist program to keep within the limitation i have set it be both possible and imperative to adopt other new measure that we cannot afford to postpone this measure be base on a series of fundamental premise group under four relate heading first we need to strengthen our nation by invest in our youth the future of any country which be dependent upon the will and wisdom of its citizen be damage and irreparably damage whenever any of its child be not educate to the full extent of his talent from grade school through graduate school today a estimate out of every student in the 5th grade will not even finish high school and that be a waste we cannot afford in addition there be no reason why one million young american out of school and out of work should all remain unwanted and often untrained on our city street when their energy can be put to good use finally the overseas success of our peace corp volunteer much of them young man and woman carry skill and idea to needy people suggest the merit of a similar corp serve our own community need in mental hospital on indian reservation in center for the age or for young delinquent in school for the illiterate or the handicap as the idealism of our youth have serve world peace so can it serve the domestic tranquility 2 we need to strengthen our nation by safeguard its health our work man and woman instead of be force to beg for help from public charity once they be old and ill should start contribute now to their own retirement health program through the social security system moreover all our miracle of medical research will count for little if we cannot reverse the grow nationwide shortage of doctor dentist and nurse and the widespread shortage of nurse home and modern urban hospital facility merely to keep the present ratio of doctor and dentist from decline any far we must over the next year increase the capacity of our medical school by percent and our dental school by percent finally and of deep concern i believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retard to the grim mercy of custodial institution too often inflict on them and on their family a needless cruelty which this nation should not endure the incidence of mental retardation in this country be three time as high as that of sweden for example and that figure can and must be reduce 3 we need to strengthen our nation by protect the basic right of its citizen the right to competent counsel must be assure to every man accuse of crime in federal court regardless of his mean and the much precious and powerful right in the world the right to vote in a free american election must not be deny to any citizen on ground of his race or color i wish that all qualify american permit to vote be will to vote but surely in this centennial year of emancipation all that who be will to vote should always be permit 4 we need to strengthen our nation by make the good and the much economical use of its resource and facility our economic health depend on healthy transportation artery and i believe the way to a much modern economical choice of national transportation service be through increase competition and decrease regulation local mass transit fare even bad be as essential a community service as hospital and highway nearly three fourth of our citizen live in urban area which occupy only percent of our land and if local transit be to survive and relieve the congestion of this city it need federal stimulation and assistance next this government be in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of much than billion we must continue to support farm income but we should not pile much farm surplus on top of the billion we already own we must maintain a stockpile of strategic material but the billion we have acquire for reason both good and bad be much much than we need and we should be empower to dispose of the excess in way which will not cause market disruption finally our already overcrowd national park and recreation area will have twice as many visitor year from now as they do today if we do not plan today for the future growth of this and other great natural asset not only park and forest but wildlife and wilderness preserve and water project of all kind our child and their child will be poor in every sense of the word this be not domestic concern alone for upon our achievement of great vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world our ability to sustain and supply the security of free man and nation our ability to command their respect for our leadership our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of payment and our ability to adjust to the change demand of cold war competition and challenge we shall be judge much by what we do at home than by what we preach abroad nothing we can do to help the develop country would help them half as much as a boom u.s economy and nothing our opponent can do to encourage their own ambition would encourage them half as much as a chronic lag u.s economy this domestic task do not divert energy from our security they provide the very foundation for freedom's survival and success iv turn to the world outside it be only a few year ago in southeast asia africa eastern europe latin america even outer space that communism seek to convey the image of a unify confident and expand empire close in on a sluggish america and a free world in disarray but few people would hold to that picture today in this past month we have reaffirm the scientific and military superiority of freedom we have double our effort in space to assure us of be first in the future we have undertake the much far reach defense improvement in the peacetime history of this country and we have maintain the frontier of freedom from viet nam to west berlin but complacency or self congratulation can imperil our security as much as the weapon of tyranny a moment of pause be not a promise of peace dangerous problem remain from cuba to the south china sea the world's prognosis prescribe in short not a year's vacation for us but a year of obligation and opportunity four special avenue of opportunity stand out the atlantic alliance the develop nation the new sino soviet difficulty and the search for worldwide peace v first how fare the grand alliance free europe be enter into a new phase of its long and brilliant history the era of colonial expansion have pass the era of national rivalry be fade and a new era of interdependence and unity be take shape defy the old prophecy of marx consent to what no conqueror can ever compel the free nation of europe be move toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity for year this movement have have our consistent support both political and economic far from resent the new europe we regard her as a welcome partner not a rival for the road to world peace and freedom be still long and there be burden which only full partner can share in support the common defense in expand world trade in align our balance of payment in aid the emergent nation in concerting political and economic policy and in welcome to our common effort other industrialize nation notably japan whose remarkable economic and political development of the s permit it now to play on the world scene a major constructive role no doubt difference of opinion will continue to get much attention than agreement on action as europe move from independence to much formal interdependence but this be honest difference among honorable associate much real and frequent in fact among our western european ally than between them and the unite state for the unity of freedom have never rely on uniformity of opinion but the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issue continue the first task of the alliance remain the common defense last month prime minister macmillan and i lay plan for a new stage in our long cooperative effort one which aim to assist in the wide task of frame a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance the nassau agreement recognize that the security of the west be indivisible and so must be our defense but it also recognize that this be a alliance of proud and sovereign nation and work good when we do not forget it it recognize far that the nuclear defense of the west be not a matter for the present nuclear power alone that france will be such a power in the future and that way must be find without increase the hazard of nuclear diffusion to increase the role of our other partner in plan man and direct a truly multilateral nuclear force within a increasingly intimate nato alliance finally the nassau agreement recognize that nuclear defense be not enough that the agree nato level of conventional strength must be meet and that the alliance cannot afford to be in a position of have to answer every threat with nuclear weapon or nothing we remain too near the nassau decision and too far from their full realization to know their place in history but i believe that for the first time the door be open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence instead of a cause of contention the next much press concern of the alliance be our common economic goal of trade and growth this nation continue to be concern about its balance of payment deficit which despite its decline remain a stubborn and troublesome problem we believe moreover that close economic tie among all free nation be essential to prosperity and peace and neither we nor the member of the european common market be so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farm or factory from the wind of foreign competition or to restrict the channel of trade with other nation of the free world if the common market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism it would undermine its own basic principle this government mean to use the authority confer on it last year by the congress to encourage trade expansion on both side of the atlantic and around the world vi 2 what of the develop and nonaligned nation they be shock by the soviet sudden and secret attempt to transform cuba into a nuclear strike base and by communist china's arrogant invasion of india they have be reassure by our prompt assistance to india by our support through the unite nation of the congo's unification by our patient search for disarmament and by the improvement in our treatment of citizen and visitor whose skin do not happen to be white and as the old colonialism recede and the neocolonialism of the communist power stand out much starkly than ever they realize much clearly that the issue in the world struggle be not communism versus capitalism but coercion versus free choice they be begin to realize that the long for independence be the same the world over whether it be the independence of west berlin or viet nam they be begin to realize that such independence run athwart all communist ambition but be in keep with our own and that our approach to their diverse need be resilient and resourceful while the communist be still rely on ancient doctrine and dogma nevertheless it be hard for any nation to focus on a external or subversive threat to its independence when its energy be drain in daily combat with the force of poverty and despair it make little sense for us to assail in speech and resolution the horror of communism to spend billion a year to prevent its military advance and then to begrudge spend largely on american product little than one 10 of that amount to help other nation strengthen their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always have thrive i be proud and i think much american be proud of a mutual defense and assistance program evolve with bipartisan support in three administration which have with all its recognize problem contribute to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty u.n member to gain independence since the 2 world war have succumb to communist control i be proud of a program that have help to arm and fee and clothe million of people who live on the front line of freedom i be especially proud that this country have put forward for the s a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the americas the alliance for progress i do not underestimate the difficulty that we face in this mutual effort among our close neighbor but the free state of this hemisphere work in close collaboration have begin to make this alliance a live reality today it be feed one out of every four school age child in latin america a extra food ration from our farm surplus it have distribute million school book and be build classroom it have help resettle ten of thousand of farm family on land they can call their own it be stimulate our good neighbor to much self help and self reform fiscal social institutional and land reform it be bring new house and hope new health and dignity to million who be forget the man and woman of this hemisphere know that the alliance cannot succeed if it be only another name for unite state handout that it can succeed only as the latin american nation themselves devote their good effort to fulfill its goal this story be the same in africa in the middle east and in asia wherever nation be will to help themselves we stand ready to help them build new bulwark of freedom we be not purchase vote for the cold war we have go to the aid of imperil nation neutral and ally alike what we do ask and all that we ask be that our help be use to good advantage and that their own effort not be divert by needless quarrel with other independent nation despite all its past achievement the continue progress of the mutual assistance program require a persistent discontent with present performance we have be reorganize this program to make it a much effective efficient instrument and that process will continue this year but free world development will still be a uphill struggle government aid can only supplement the role of private investment trade expansion commodity stabilization and above all internal self improvement the process of growth be gradual bear fruit in a decade not a day our success will be neither quick nor dramatic but if this program be ever to be end our failure in a dozen country would be sudden and certain neither money nor technical assistance however can be our only weapon against poverty in the end the crucial effort be one of purpose require the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism and nothing carry the spirit of this american idealism much effectively to the far corner of the earth than the american peace corp a year ago little than peace corp volunteer be on the job a year from now they will numb much than man and woman age to will to give year of their life to help people in other land there be in fact nearly a million american serve their country and the cause of freedom in overseas post a record no other people can match surely that of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly by support our aid program by open our door to foreign visitor and diplomat and student and by prove day by day by deed as good as word that we be a just and generous people vii 3 what comfort can we take from the increase strain and tension within the communist bloc here hope must be temper with caution for the soviet chinese disagreement be over mean not end a dispute over how good to bury the free world be no ground for western rejoice nevertheless while a strain be not a fracture it be clear that the force of diversity be at work inside the communist camp despite all the iron discipline of regimentation and all the iron dogmatism's of ideology marx be prove wrong once again for it be the close communist society not the free and open society which carry within themselves the seed of internal disintegration the disarray of the communist empire have be heighten by two other formidable force one be the historical force of nationalism and the yearn of all man to be free the other be the gross inefficiency of their economy for a close society be not open to idea of progress and a police state find that it cannot command the grain to grow new nation ask to choose between two compete system need only compare condition in east and west germany eastern and western europe north and south viet nam they need only compare the disillusionment of communist cuba with the promise of the alliance for progress and all the world know that no successful system build a wall to keep its people in and freedom out and the wall of shame divide berlin be a symbol of communist failure viii finally what can we do to move from the present pause toward endure peace again i would counsel caution i foresee no spectacular reversal in communist method or goal but if all this trend and development can persuade the soviet union to walk the path of peace then let her know that all free nation will journey with her but until that choice be make and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security the free people have no choice but to keep their arm nearby this country therefore continue to require the good defense in the world a defense which be suit to the sixty this mean unfortunately a rise defense budget for there be no substitute for adequate defense and no bargain basement way of achieve it it mean the expenditure of much than billion this year on nuclear weapon system alone a sum which be about equal to the combine defense budget of our european ally but it also mean improve air and missile defense improve civil defense a strengthen anti guerrilla capacity and of prime importance much powerful and flexible nonnuclear force for threat of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression and a line of destroyer in a quarantine or a division of good equip man on a border may be much useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapon beyond all rational need but our commitment to national safety be not a commitment to expand our military establishment indefinitely we do not dismiss disarmament as merely a idle dream for we believe that in the end it be the only way to assure the security of all without impair the interest of any nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement while we shall never weary in the defense of freedom neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit of peace in this quest the unite nation require our full and continue support its value in serve the cause of peace have be show anew in its role in the west new guinea settlement in its use as a forum for the cuban crisis and in its task of unification in the congo today the unite nation be primarily the protector of the small and the weak and a safety valve for the strong tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law a world in which no nation dictate the destiny of another and in which the vast resource now devote to destructive mean will serve constructive end in short let our adversary choose if they choose peaceful competition they shall have it if they come to realize that their ambition cannot succeed if they see their war of liberation and subversion will ultimately fail if they recognize that there be much security in accept inspection than in permit new nation to master the black art of nuclear war and if they be will to turn their energy as we be to the great unfinished task of our own people then surely the area of agreement can be very wide indeed a clear understand about berlin stability in southeast asia a end to nuclear test new check on surprise or accidental attack and ultimately general and complete disarmament ix for we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a worldwide victory of man the modern globe be too small its weapon be too destructive and its disorder be too contagious to permit any other kind of victory to achieve this end the unite state will continue to spend a great portion of its national production than any other people in the free world for year no other free nation have demand so much of itself through hot war and cold through recession and prosperity through the age of the atom and outer space the american people have never falter and their faith have never flag if at time our action seem to make life difficult for other it be only because history have make life difficult for us all but difficult day need not be dark i think this be proud and memorable day in the cause of peace and freedom we be proud for example of major rudolf anderson who give his life over the island of cuba we salute specialist james allen johnson who die on the border of south korea we pay honor to sergeant gerald pendell who be kill in viet nam they be among the many who in this century far from home have die for our country our task now and the task of all american be to live up to their commitment my friend i close on a note of hope we be not lull by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clear sky above we know the turbulence that lie below and the storm that be beyond the horizon this year but now the wind of change appear to be blow much strongly than ever in the world of communism as good as our own for year we have sail with that wind at our back and with the tide of human freedom in our favor we steer our ship with hope as thomas jefferson say leave fear astern today we still welcome that wind of change and we have every reason to believe that our tide be run strong with thank to almighty god for see us through a perilous passage we ask his help anew in guide the good ship union mr speaker mr president member of the house and senate my fellow american i will be brief for our time be necessarily short and our agendum be already long last year's congressional session be the long in peacetime history with that foundation let us work together to make this year's session the good in the nation's history let this session of congress be know as the session which do much for civil right than the last hundred session combine as the session which enact the much far reach tax cut of our time as the session which declare all out war on human poverty and unemployment in this unite state as the session which finally recognize the health need of all our old citizen as the session which reform our tangle transportation and transit policy as the session which achieve the much effective efficient foreign aid program ever and as the session which help to build much home much school much library and much hospital than any single session of congress in the history of our republic all this and much can and must be do it can be do by this summer and it can be do without any increase in spend in fact under the budget that i shall shortly submit it can be do with a actual reduction in federal expenditure and federal employment we have in a unique opportunity and obligation to prove the success of our system to disprove that cynic and critic at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence if we fail if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless senseless quarrel between democrat and republican or between the house and the senate or between the south and north or between the congress and the administration then history will rightfully judge us harshly but if we succeed if we can achieve this goal by forge in this country a great sense of union then and only then can we take full satisfaction in the state of the union ii here in the congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharge the public business with clarity and dispatch vote each important proposal up or vote it down but at less bring it to a fair and a final vote let us carry forward the plan and program of john fitzgerald kennedy not because of our sorrow or sympathy but because they be right in his memory today i especially ask all member of my own political faith in this election year to put your country ahead of your party and to always debate principle never debate personality for my part i pledge a progressive administration which be efficient and honest and frugal the budget to be submit to the congress shortly be in full accord with this pledge it will cut our deficit in half from billion to million it will be in proportion to our national output the small budget since it will call for a substantial reduction in federal employment a feat accomplish only once before in the last year while maintain the full strength of our combat defense it will call for the low numb of civilian personnel in the department of defense since it will call for total expenditure of million compare to million for the current year a reduction of much than million it will call for new obligational authority of million a reduction of much than billion below last year's request of million but it be not a standstill budget for america cannot afford to stand still our population be grow our economy be much complex our people's need be expand but by close down obsolete installation by curtail little urgent program by cut back where cut back seem to be wise by insist on a dollar's worth for a dollar spend i be able to recommend in this reduce budget the much federal support in history for education for health for retrain the unemployed and for help the economically and the physically handicap this budget and this year's legislative program be design to help each and every american citizen fulfill his basic hope his hope for a fair chance to make good his hope for fair play from the law his hope for a full time job on full time pay his hope for a decent home for his family in a decent community his hope for a good school for his child with good teacher and his hope for security when face with sickness or unemployment or old age iii unfortunately many american live on the outskirts of hope some because of their poverty and some because of their color and all too many because of both our task be to help replace their despair with opportunity this administration today here and now declare unconditional war on poverty in america i urge this congress and all american to join with me in that effort it will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon or strategy will suffice but we shall not rest until that war be win the rich nation on earth can afford to win it we cannot afford to lose it one thousand dollar invest in salvage a unemployable youth today can return or much in his lifetime poverty be a national problem require improve national organization and support but this attack to be effective must also be organize at the state and the local level and must be support and direct by state and local effort for the war against poverty will not be win here in washington it must be win in the field in every private home in every public office from the courthouse to the white house the program i shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that one 5 of all american family with income too small to even meet their basic need our chief weapon in a much pinpoint attack will be good school and good health and good home and good train and good job opportunity to help much american especially young american escape from squalor and misery and unemployment roll where other citizen help to carry them very often a lack of job and money be not the cause of poverty but the symptom the cause may lie deep in our failure to give our fellow citizen a fair chance to develop their own capacity in a lack of education and train in a lack of medical care and house in a lack of decent community in which to live and bring up their child but whatever the cause our joint federal local effort must pursue poverty pursue it wherever it exist in city slum and small town in sharecropper shack or in migrant worker camp on indian reservation among white as good as negro among the young as good as the age in the boom town and in the depress area our aim be not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure it and above all to prevent it no single piece of legislation however be go to suffice we will launch a special effort in the chronically distress area of appalachia we must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program we must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless aimless hopeless youngster to work on useful project we must distribute much food to the needy through a broad food stamp program we must create a national service corp to help the economically handicap of our own country as the peace corp now help that abroad we must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high level commission on automation if we have the brain power to invent this machine we have the brain power to make certain that they be a boon and not a bane to humanity we must extend the coverage of our minimum wage law to much than million worker now lack this basic protection of purchase power we must by include special school aid fund as part of our education program improve the quality of teach train and counsel in our hard hit area we must build much library in every area and much hospital and nurse home under the hill burton act and train much nurse to staff them we must provide hospital insurance for our old citizen finance by every worker and his employer under social security contribute no much than a month during the employee's work career to protect him in his old age in a dignify manner without cost to the treasury against the devastate hardship of prolong or repeat illness we must as a part of a revise house and urban renewal program give much help to that displace by slum clearance provide much house for our poor and our elderly and seek as our ultimate goal in our free enterprise system a decent home for every american family we must help obtain much modern mass transit within our community as good as low cost transportation between them above all we must release billion of tax reduction into the private spend stream to create new job and new market in every area of this land iv this program be obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone every american will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital cost of their age parent every american community will benefit from the construction or modernization of school library hospital and nurse home from the train of much nurse and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit and every individual american taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the early possible passage of the pend tax bill from both the new investment it will bring and the new job that it will create that tax bill have be thoroughly discuss for a year now we need action the new budget clearly allow it our taxpayer surely deserve it our economy strongly demand it and every month of delay dilute its benefit in for consumption for investment and for employment for until the bill be sign its investment incentive cannot be deem certain and the withhold rate cannot be reduce and the much damage and devastate thing you can do to any businessman in america be to keep him in doubt and to keep him guess on what our tax policy be and i say that we should now reduce to percent instead of percent our withhold rate i therefore urge the congress to take final action on this bill by the first of february if at all possible for however proud we may be of the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last year we should not and we cannot permit it to pause in for the first time in history we cross the million job mark but we will soon need much than million job in our gross national product reach the billion level billion high than when we take office but it easily can and it should be still billion high today than it be wage and profit and family income be also at their high level in history but i would remind you that million worker and percent of our industrial capacity be still idle today we need a tax cut now to keep this country move v for our goal be not merely to spread the work our goal be to create much job i believe the enactment of a hour week would sharply increase cost would invite inflation would impair our ability to compete and merely share instead of create employment but i be equally oppose to the or hour week in that industry where consistently excessive use of overtime cause increase unemployment so therefore i recommend legislation authorize the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on a industry by industry basis as to where a high penalty rate for overtime would increase job opening without unduly increase cost and authorize the establishment of such high rate vi let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear all of this increase opportunity in employment in education in house and in every field must be open to american of every color as far as the writ of federal law will run we must abolish not some but all racial discrimination for this be not merely a economic issue or a social political or international issue it be a moral issue and it must be meet by the passage this session of the bill now pend in the house all member of the public should have equal access to facility open to the public all member of the public should be equally eligible for federal benefit that be finance by the public all member of the public should have a equal chance to vote for public official and to send their child to good public school and to contribute their talent to the public good today american of all race stand side by side in berlin and in viet nam they die side by side in korea surely they can work and eat and travel side by side in their own country vii we must also lift by legislation the bar of discrimination against that who seek entry into our country particularly that who have much need skill and that join their family in establish preference a nation that be build by the immigrant of all land can ask that who now seek admission what can you do for our country but we should not be ask in what country be you bear viii for our ultimate goal be a world without war a world make safe for diversity in which all man good and idea can freely move across every border and every boundary we must advance toward this goal in in at less different way not as partisan but as patriot first wc must maintain and our reduce defense budget will maintain that margin of military safety and superiority obtain through year of steadily increase both the quality and the quantity of our strategic our conventional and our antiguerilla force in we will be good prepare than ever before to defend the cause of freedom whether it be threaten by outright aggression or by the infiltration practice by that in hanoi and havana who ship arm and man across international border to foment insurrection and we must continue to use that strength as john kennedy use it in the cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibility of last peace 2 we must take new step and we shall make new proposal at geneva toward the control and the eventual abolition of arm even in the absence of agreement we must not stockpile arm beyond our need or seek a excess of military power that can be provocative as good as wasteful it be in this spirit that in this fiscal year we be cut back our production of enrich uranium by percent we be shut down four plutonium pile we be close many nonessential military installation and it be in this spirit that we today call on our adversary to do the same 3 we must make increase use of our food as a instrument of peace make it available by sale or trade or loan or donation to hungry people in all nation which tell us of their need and accept proper condition of distribution 4 we must assure our pre eminence in the peaceful exploration of outer space focus on a expedition to the moon in this decade in cooperation with other power if possible alone if necessary 5 we must expand world trade have recognize in the act of that we must buy as good as sell we now expect our trade partner to recognize that we must sell as good as buy we be will to give them competitive access to our market ask only that they do the same for us 6 we must continue through such measure as the interest equalization tax as good as the cooperation of other nation our recent progress toward balance our international account this administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the dollar 7 we must become good neighbor with the free state of the americas work with the council of the oas with a strong alliance for progress and with all the man and woman of this hemisphere who really believe in liberty and justice for all 8 we must strengthen the ability of free nation everywhere to develop their independence and raise their standard of live and thereby frustrate that who prey on poverty and chaos to do this the rich must help the poor and we must do our part we must achieve a much rigorous administration of our development assistance with large role for private investor for other industrialize nation and for international agency and for the recipient nation themselves 9 we must strengthen our atlantic and pacific partnership maintain our alliance and make the unite nation a much effective instrument for national independence and international order 10 and finally we must develop with our ally new mean of bridge the gap between the east and the west face danger boldly wherever danger exist but be equally bold in our search for new agreement which can enlarge the hope of all while violate the interest of none in short i would say to the congress that we must be constantly prepare for the bad and constantly act for the good we must be strong enough to win any war and we must be wise enough to prevent one we shall neither act as aggressor nor tolerate act of aggression we intend to bury no one and we do not intend to be bury we can fight if we must as we have fight before but we pray that we will never have to fight again ix my good friend and my fellow american in this last sorrowful week we have learn anew that nothing be so endure as faith and nothing be so degrade as hate john kennedy be a victim of hate but he be also a great builder of faith faith in our fellow american whatever their

wonder whether we be in the grip of historical decay we know that history be ours to make and if there be great danger there be now also the excitement of great expectation america and the communist nation yet we still live in a trouble and perilous world there be no long a single threat there be many they differ in intensity and in danger they require different attitude and different answer with the soviet union we seek peaceful understanding that can lessen the danger to freedom last fall i ask the american people to choose that course i will carry forward their command if we be to live together in peace we must come to know each other good i be sure that the american people would welcome a chance to listen to the soviet leader on our television as i would like the soviet people to hear our leader on theirs i hope the new soviet leader can visit america so they can learn about our country at firsthand in eastern europe restless nation be slowly begin to assert their identity your government assist by the leader in american labor and business be now explore way to increase peaceful trade with this country and with the soviet union i will report our conclusion to the congress in asia communism wear a much aggressive face we see that in viet nam why be we there we be there first because a friendly nation have ask us for help against the communist aggression ten year ago our president pledge our help three president have support that pledge we will not break it now 2 our own security be tie to the peace of asia twice in one generation we have have to fight against aggression in the far east to ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much large war our goal be peace in southeast asia that will come only when aggressor leave their neighbor in peace what be at stake be the cause of freedom and in that cause america will never be find want the non communist world but communism be not the only source of trouble and unrest there be old and deep source in the misery of nation and in man's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a good life with the free republic of latin america i have always feel and my country have always feel

we continue to pursue our goal of year a europe that be grow in strength unity and cooperation with america a great unfinished task be the reunification of germany through self determination this european policy be not base on any abstract design it be base on the reality of common interest and common value common danger and common expectation this reality will continue to have their way especially i think in our expand trade and especially in our common defense free american have shape the policy of the unite state and because we know this reality that policy have be and will be in the interest of europe free european must shape the course of europe and for the same reason that course have be and will be in our interest and in the interest of freedom i find this truth confirm in my talk with european leader in the last year i hope to repay this visit to some of our friend in europe this year in africa and asia we be witness the turbulent unfold of new nation and continent we welcome them to the society of nation we be commit to help that seek to strengthen their own independence and to work much closely with that government dedicate to the welfare of all of their people we seek not fidelity to a iron faith but a diversity of belief as vary as man himself we seek not to extend the power of america but the progress of humanity we seek not to dominate other but to strengthen the freedom of all people i will seek new way to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the grow scarcity in world resource finally we renew our commitment to the continue growth and the effectiveness of the unite nation the frustration of the unite nation be a product of the world that we live in and not of the institution which give them voice it be far good to throw this difference open to the assembly of nation than to permit them to fester in silent danger this be some of the goal of the american nation in the world in which we live for ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame neither gratitude nor obedience we seek peace we seek freedom we seek to enrich the life of man for that be the world in which we will flourish and

spirit we build this nation to serve its people we want to grow and build and create but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man we do not intend to live in the midst of abundance isolate from neighbor and nature confine by blight city and bleak suburb stunt by a poverty of learn and a emptiness of leisure the great society ask not how much but how good not only how to create wealth but how to use it not only how fast we be go but where we be head it propose as the first test for a nation the quality of its people this kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swell rich and surge power it will not be the gift of government or the creation of president it will require of every american for many generation both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey and like freedom itself it will always be challenge and not fulfillment and tonight we accept that challenge a national agendum i propose that we begin a program in education to

have a step up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police force our people have a right to feel secure in their home and on their street and that right just must be secure nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highway i will propose a highway safety act of to seek a end to this mount tragedy we must also act to prevent the deception of the american consumer require all package to state clearly and truthfully their content all interest and credit charge to be fully reveal and keep harmful drug and cosmetic away from our store it be the genius of our constitution that under its shelter of endure institution and root principle there be ample room for the rich fertility of american political invention we must change to master change i propose to

skill and their wisdom today too the work of government be far much complex than in our early year require much time to learn and much time to master the technical task of legislate and a long term will serve to attract much man of the high quality to political life the nation the principle of democracy and i think each congressional district will all be good serve by a year term for member of the house and i urge your swift action iv tonight the cup of peril be full in vietnam that conflict be not a isolate episode but another great event in the policy that we have follow with strong consistency since world war ii the touchstone of that policy be the interest of the unite state the welfare and the freedom of the people of the unite state but nation sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass in a world that have grow small and dangerous pursuit of narrow aim can bring decay and even disaster a america that be mighty beyond description yet live in a hostile or

nation i will discuss them fully in the month to come and i will follow the five continue line of policy that america have follow under its last four president the first principle be strength tonight i can tell you that we be strong enough to keep all of our commitment we will need expenditure of billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense may while special vietnam expenditure for the next fiscal year be estimate to increase by billion i can tell you that all the other expenditure put together in the entire federal budget will rise this come year by only billion this be true because of the stringent cost conscious economy program inaugurate in the defense department and follow by the other department of government a 2 principle of policy be the effort to control and to reduce and to ultimately eliminate the modern engine of destruction we will vigorously pursue exist proposal and seek new one to control arm and to stop the spread of nuclear weapon a 3 major principle of our foreign policy be to help build that association of nation which reflect the opportunity and the necessity of the modern world by strengthen the common defense by stimulate

international finance a 4 endure strand of policy have be to help improve the life of man from the marshall plan to this very moment tonight that policy have rest on the claim of compassion and the certain knowledge that only a people advance in expectation will build secure and peaceful land this year i propose major new direction in our program of foreign assistance to help that country who will help themselves we will conduct a worldwide attack on the problem of hunger and disease and ignorance we will place the matchless skill and the resource of our own great america in farm and in fertilizer at the service of that country commit to develop a modern agriculture we will aid that who educate the young in other land and we will give child in other continent the same head start that we be try to give our own child to advance this end i will propose the international education act of i will also propose the international health act of to strike at disease by a new effort to bring

country try to control population growth by increase our research and we will earmark fund to help their effort in the next year from our foreign aid source we propose to dedicate billion to this effort and we call on all who have the mean to join us in this work in the world the 5 and much important principle of our foreign policy be support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institution for a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walk the way that it have choose to walk for itself we follow this principle by encourage the end of colonial rule we follow this principle abroad as good as at home by continue hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another we follow this principle by build bridge to eastern europe and i will ask the congress for authority to remove the special tariff restriction which be a barrier to increase trade between the east and the west the insistent urge toward national independence be the strong force of today's world in which we live in africa and asia and latin america it be shatter the design of that who would subdue other to their idea or their will it be erode the unity of what be once a stalinist empire in recent month a numb of nation have east out that who would subject them to the ambition of mainland china history be on the side of freedom and be on the side of society shape from the genius of each people history do not favor a single system or belief unless force be use to make it so that be why it have be necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy to defend it in berlin in korea in cuba and tonight in vietnam for tonight as so many night before young american struggle and young american die in a distant land tonight as so many night before the american nation be ask to sacrifice the blood of its child and the fruit of its labor for the love of its freedom how many time in my lifetime and in yours have the american people gather as they do now to hear their president tell them of conflict and tell them of danger each time they have answer they have answer with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this nation require and they do again tonight in vietnam not too many year ago vietnam be a peaceful if trouble land in the north be a independent communist government in the south a people struggle to build a nation with the friendly help of the unite state there be some in south vietnam who wish to force communist rule on their own people but their progress be slight their hope of success be dim then little much than year ago north vietnam decide on conquest and from that day to this soldier and supply have move from north to south in a swell stream that be swallow the remnant of revolution in aggression as the assault mount our choice gradually become clear we can leave abandon south vietnam to its attacker and to certain conquest or we can stay and fight beside the people of south vietnam we stay and we will stay until aggression have stop we will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelty of its enemy a people who have stake their life and independence on america's solemn pledge a pledge which have grow through the commitment of three american president we will stay because in asia and around the world be country whose independence rest in large measure on confidence in america's word and in america's protection to yield to force in vietnam would weaken that confidence would undermine the independence of many land and would whet the appetite of aggression we would have to fight in one land and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of asia to the domination of communist and we do not intend to abandon asia to conquest last year the nature of the war in vietnam change again swiftly increase number of arm man from the north cross the border to join force that be already in the south attack and terror increase spur and encourage by the belief that the unite state lack the will to continue and that their victory be near despite our desire to limit conflict it be necessary to act to hold back the mount aggression to give courage to the people of the south and to make our firmness clear to the north thus we begin limit air action against military target in north vietnam we increase our fight force to its present strength tonight of man this move have not end the aggression but they have prevent its success the aim of the enemy have be put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of american and their ally and by the endure courage of the south vietnamese who i can tell you have lose eight man last year for every one of ours the enemy be no long close to victory time be no long on his side there be no cause to doubt the american commitment our decision to stand firm have be match by our desire for peace in alone we have private talk for peace in vietnam with friend and adversary throughout the world since christmas your government have labor again with imagination and endurance to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement for day now we and our vietnamese ally have drop no bomb in north vietnam able and experience spokesman have visit in behalf of america much than country we have talk to much than a hundred government all that we have relation with and some that we don't we have talk to the unite nation and we have call upon all of its member to make any contribution that they can toward help obtain peace in public statement and in private communication to adversary and to friend in rome and warsaw in paris and tokyo in africa and throughout this hemisphere america have make her position abundantly clear we seek neither territory nor base economic domination or military alliance in vietnam we fight for the principle of self determination that the people of south vietnam should be able to choose their own course choose it in free election without violence without terror and without fear the people of all vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification this be all we want for south vietnam it be all the people of south vietnam want and if there be a single nation on this earth that desire little than this for its own people then let its voice be hear we have also make it clear from hanoi to new york that there be no arbitrary limit to our search for peace we stand by the geneva agreement of and we will meet at any conference table we will discuss any proposal four point or fourteen or forty and we will consider the view of any group we will work for a cease fire now or once discussion have begin we will respond if other reduce their use of force and we will withdraw our soldier once south vietnam be securely guarantee the right to shape its own future we have say all this and we have ask and hope and we have wait for a response so far we have receive no response to prove either success or failure we have carry our quest for peace to many nation and people because we share this planet with other whose future in large measure be tie to our own action and whose counsel be necessary to our own hope we have find understand and support and we know they wait with us tonight for some response that can lead to peace i wish tonight that i can give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the come month but we just cannot know what the future may require we may have to face long hard combat or a long hard conference or even both at once until peace come or if it do not come our course be clear we will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of south vietnam we will strive to limit the conflict for we wish neither increase destruction nor do we want to invite increase danger but we will give our fight man what they must have every gun and every dollar and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge and we will continue to help the people of south vietnam care for that that be ravage by battle create progress in the village and carry forward the heal hope of peace as good they can amidst the uncertain terror of war and let me be absolutely clear the day may become month and the month may become year but we will stay as long as aggression command us to battle there may be some who do not want peace whose ambition stretch so far that war in vietnam be but a welcome and convenient episode in a immense design to subdue history to their will but for other it must now be clear the choice be not between peace and victory it lie between peace and the ravage of a conflict from which they can only lose the people of vietnam north and south seek the same thing the share need of man the need for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil free from the arbitrary horror of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of that who master their own destiny for many painful year in war and revolution and infrequent peace they have struggle to fulfill that need it be a crime against mankind that so much courage and so much will and so many dream must be fling on the fire of war and death to all of that catch up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight let us choose peace and with it the wondrous work of peace and beyond that the time when hope reach toward consummation and life be the servant of life in this work we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve v this be the state of the union but over it all wealth and promise and expectation lie our trouble awareness of american man at war tonight how many man who listen to me tonight have serve their nation in other war how very many be not here to listen the war in vietnam be not like this other war yet finally war be always the same it be young man dying in the fullness of their promise it be try to kill a man that you do not even know good enough to hate therefore to know war be to know that there be still madness in this world many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me but there be a difference for finally i must be the one to order our gun to fire against all the much inward pull of my desire for we have child to teach and we have sick to be cure and we have man to be free there be poor to be lift up and there be city to be build and there be a world to be help yet we do what we must i be hopeful and i will try as good i can with everything i have get to end this battle and to return our son to their desire yet as long as other will challenge america's security and test the clearness of our belief with fire and steel then we must stand or see the promise of two century tremble i believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk and from that belief your president summon his strength for the trial that lie ahead in the day to come the work must be our work now scar by the weakness of man with whatever guidance god may offer us we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality strive to ennoble the life of man on earth thank you and goodnight mr speaker mr vice president distinguish member of the congress i share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the much beloved respect and effective member of this body the distinguish representative from rhode island mr fogarty i have come here tonight to report to you that this be a time of test for our nation at home the question be whether we will continue work for good opportunity for all american when much american be already live good than any people in history abroad the question be whether we have the stay power to fight a very costly war when the objective be limit and the danger to us be seemingly remote so our test be not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the danger to us be obvious and dose at hand but rather whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant and some think that it be safe to lie down our burden i have come tonight be ask this congress and this nation to resolve that issue to meet our commitment at home and abroad to continue to build a good america and to reaffirm this nation's allegiance to freedom as president abraham lincoln say we must ask where we be and whither we be tend i the last year bear witness to our determination to make this a good country we have strike down legal barrier to equality we have improve the education of million deprive child and this year alone we have enable almost million student to go to college we have bring medical care to old people who be unable to afford it three and one half million american have already receive treatment under medicare since july we have build a strong economy that have put almost million much american on the payroll in the last year alone we have include much than million new worker under a high minimum wage we have launch new train program to provide job skill for almost million american we have help much than a thousand local community to attack poverty in the neighborhood of the poor we have set out to rebuild our city on a scale that have never be attempt before we have begin to rescue our water from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside our city and our town we have give million young american a chance to earn through the neighborhood youth corp or through head start a chance to learn so together we have try to meet the need of our people and we have succeed in create a good life for the many as good as the few now we must answer whether our gain shall be the foundation of far progress or whether they shall be only monument to what may have be abandon now by a people who lack the will to see their great work through i believe that our people do not want to quit though the task be great the work hard often frustrate and success be a matter not of day or month but of year and sometimes it may be even decade ii i have come here tonight to discuss with you five way of carry forward the progress of this last year this five way concern program partnership priority prosperity and peace first program we must see to it i think that this new program that we have pass work effectively and be administer in the good possible way three year ago we set out to create this new instrument of social progress this require trial and error and it have produce both but as we learn through success and failure we be change our strategy and we be try to improve our tactic in the long run this start some reward other inadequate and disappoint be crucial to success one example be the struggle to make life good for the little fortunate among us on a similar occasion at this rostrum in i hear a great american president harry s truman declare this the american people have decide that poverty be just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease many listen to president truman that day here in this chamber but few understand what be require and do anything about it the executive branch and the congress wait long year before ever take any action on that challenge as it do on many other challenge that great president present and when year ago you here in the congress join with me in a declaration of war on poverty then i warn it will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon will suffice but we shall not rest until that war be win and i have come here to renew that pledge tonight i recommend that we intensify our effort to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation's progress i shall propose certain administrative change suggest by the congress as good as some that we have learn from our own trial and error i shall urge special method and special fund to reach the hundred of thousand of american that be now trap in the ghetto of our big city and through head start to try to reach out to our very young little child the chance to learn be their bright hope and must command our full determination for learn bring skill and skill bring job and job bring responsibility and dignity as good as tax this war like the war in vietnam be not a simple one there be no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart the enemy be not easy to perceive or to isolate or to destroy there be mistake and there be setback but we be move and our direction be forward this be true with other program that be make and break new grind some do not yet have the capacity to absorb good or wisely all the money that can be put into them administrative skill and train manpower be just as vital to their success as dollar and i believe that skill will come but it will take time and patience and hard work success cannot be force at a single stroke so we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success be to come as we know it must we have do much in the space of short year work together i have recommend and you the congress have approve different reorganization plan combine and consolidate many bureau of this government and create two entirely new cabinet department i have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department a department of business and labor by combine the department of commerce with the department of labor and other relate agency i think we can create a much economical efficient and streamline instrument that will good serve a grow nation this be our goal throughout the entire federal government every program will be thoroughly evaluate grant in aid program will be improve and simplify as desire by many of our local administrator and our governor where there have be mistake we will try very hard to correct them where there have be progress we will try to build upon it our 2 objective be partnership to create a effective partnership at all level of government and i should treasure nothing much than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress the 88th and the 89th congress pass much social and economic legislation than any two single congress in american history much of you who be member of that congress vote to pass much of that measure but your effort will come to nothing unless it reach the people federal energy be essential but it be not enough only a total work partnership among federal state and local government can succeed the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization each private institution and each responsible citizen each state county and city need to examine its capacity for government in today's world as we be examine ours in the executive department and as i see you be examine yours some will need to reorganize and reshape their method of administration as we be do other will need to revise their constitution and their law to bring them up to date as we be do above all i think we must work together and find way in which the multitude of small jurisdiction can be bring together much efficiently during the past year we have return to state and local government about billion in grant in aid this year alone percent of our federal expenditure for domestic program will be distribute through the state and local government with federal assistance state and local government by will be spend close to billion annually this enormous sum must be use wisely honestly and effectively we intend to work closely with the state and the locality to do exactly that our 3 objective be priority to move ahead on the priority that we have establish within the resource that be available i wish of course that we can do all that should be do and that we can do it now but the nation have many commitment and responsibility which make heavy demand upon our total resource no administration would much eagerly utilize for this program all the resource they require than the administration that start them so let us resolve now to do all that we can with what we have know that it be far far much than we have ever do before and far far little than our problem will ultimately require let us create new opportunity for our child and our young american who need special help we should strengthen the head start program begin it for child year old and maintain its educational momentum by follow through in the early year we should try new method of child development and care from the early year before it be too late to correct and i will propose this measure to the 90th congress let us insure that old american and neglect american share in their nation's progress we should raise social security payment by a overall average of percent that will add billion million to social security payment in the first year i will recommend that each of the million american now receive payment get a increase of at less percent i will ask that you raise the minimum payment by percent from to a month and to guarantee a minimum benefit of a month for that with a total of year of coverage we must raise the limit that retire worker can earn without lose social security income we must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age we should embark upon a major effort to provide self help assistance to the forget in our midst the american indian and the migratory farm worker and we should reach with the hand of understand to help that who live in rural

slum into place of decency through the landmark model city program i intend to seek for this effort this year the full amount that you in congress authorize last year we should call upon the genius of private industry and the much advance technology to help rebuild our great city we should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at its source and because air like water do not respect manmade boundary we should set up regional airsheds throughout this great land we should continue to carry to every corner of the nation our campaign for a beautiful america to dean up our town to make them much beautiful our city our countryside by create much park and much seashore and much open space for our child to play in and for the generation that come after us to enjoy we should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen before a jury in seek a job in exercise his civil right we should find a solution to fair house so that every american regardless of color have a decent home of his choice we should modernize our selective service system the national commission on selective service will shortly submit its report i will send you new recommendation to meet our military manpower need but let us resolve that this be to be the congress that make our draft law as fair and as effective as possible we should protect what justice brandeis call the right much value by civilize man the right to privacy we should outlaw all wiretapping public and private wherever and whenever it occur except when the security of this nation itself be at stake and only then with the strict governmental safeguard and we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional power to outlaw electronic bug and snoop i hope this congress will try to help me do much for the consumer we should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly express where average citizen can understand it we should immediately take step to prevent massive power failure to safeguard the home against hazardous household product and to assure safety in the pipeline that carry natural gas across our nation we should extend medicare benefit that be now deny to permanently and totally

to american who move their residence we should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our home educate our family and to provide assistance in our classroom we should insist that the public interest be fully serve through the public's airwave and i will propose this measure to the 90th congress now we come to a question that weigh very heavily on all our mind on yours and mine this nation must make a all out effort to combat crime the 89th congress give us a new start in the attack on crime by pass the law enforcement assistance act that i recommend we appoint the national crime commission to study crime in america and to recommend the good way to carry that attack forward and while we do not have all the answer on the basis of its preliminary recommendation we be ready to move this be not a war that washington alone can win the idea of a national police force be repugnant to the american people crime must be root out in local community by local authority our policeman must be good train must be good pay and must be good support by the local citizen that they try to serve and to protect the national government can and expect to help and so i will recommend to the 90th congress the safe street and crime control act of it will enable us to assist that state and city that try to make their street and home safe their police force good their correction system much effective and their court much efficient when the congress approve the federal government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost percent of the cost of develop the state and local plan master plan to combat crime in their area percent of the cost of train new tactical unit develop instant communication and special alarm system and introduce the late equipment and technique so that they can become weapon in the war on crime percent of the cost of build crime laboratory and police academy type center so that our citizen can be protect by the good train and serve by the good equip police to be find anywhere we will also recommend new method to prevent juvenile delinquent from become adult delinquent we will seek new partnership with state and city in order to deal with this hideous narcotic problem and we will recommend strict control on the sale of firearm at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america as abraham lincoln once say must let reverence for the law become the political religion of the nation our country's law must be respect order must be maintain and i will support with all the constitutional power the president possess our nation's law enforcement official in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our community many of this priority proposal will be build on foundation that have already be lay some will necessarily be small at first but every begin be a consequence if we postpone this urgent work now it will simply have to be do late and late we will pay a much high price our 4 objective be prosperity to keep our economy move ahead move ahead steadily and safely we have now enjoy year of unprecedented and reward prosperity last year in wage be the high in history and the unemployment rate announce yesterday reach the low point in year total after tax income of american family rise nearly percent corporate profit after tax rise a little much than percent our gross national product advance percent to about billion income per farm go up percent now we have be greatly concern because consumer price rise percent over the month since we decide to send troop to vietnam this be much than we have expect and the government try to do everything that we know how to do to hold it down yet we be not as successful as we wish to be in the month after we enter world war ii price rise not percent but percent in the first month after korea after the conflict break out there price rise not percent but percent during that two period we have opa price control that the congress give us and war labor board wage control since vietnam we have not ask for that control and we have try to avoid impose them we believe that we have do good but we make no pretense of have be successful or do as good as we wish our great disappointment in the economy during be the excessive rise in interest rate and the tighten of credit they impose very severe and very unfair burden on our home buyer and on our home builder and all that associate with the home industry last january and again last september i recommend fiscal and moderate tax measure to try to restrain the unbalance pace of economic expansion legislatively and administratively we take several billion out of the economy with this measure in both instance the congress approve much of the recommendation rather promptly as end price stability be seemingly be restore wholesale price be low tonight than they be in august so be retail food price monetary condition be also ease much interest rate have retreat from their early peak much money now seem to be available give the cooperation of the federal reserve system which i so earnestly seek i be confident that this movement can continue i pledge the american people that i will do everything in a president's power to low interest rate and to ease money in this country the federal home loan bank board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to saving and loan association a additional billion and will low from percent to percent the interest rate charge on that loan we shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy grow without new inflationary spiral that will finance responsibly the need of our man in vietnam and the progress of our people at home that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus and will press forward toward easy credit and toward low interest rate i recommend to the congress a surcharge of percent on both corporate and individual income tax to last for year or for so long as the unusual expenditure associate with our effort in vietnam continue i will promptly recommend a early termination date if a reduction in this expenditure permit it this surcharge will raise revenue by some billion in the first year for example a person whose tax payment the tax he owe be will pay under this proposal a extra over the month period or a month the overwhelm majority of american who pay tax today be below that figure and they will pay substantially little than a month marry couple with two child with income up to per year will be exempt from this tax as will single people with a income of up to a year now if american today still pay the income and excise tax rate in effect when i come into the presidency in the year their annual tax would have be over billion much than at present tax rate so this proposal be that while we have this problem and this emergency in vietnam while we be try to meet the need of our people at home your government ask for slightly much than one 4 of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal within prudent limit and to give our country and to give our fight man the help they need in this hour of trial for fiscal we estimate the budget expenditure to be billion and revenue of billion that will leave us a deficit this year of billion for fiscal we estimate budget expenditure of billion and with the tax measure recommend and a continue strong economy we estimate revenue will be billion the deficit then will be billion i will very soon forward all of my recommendation to the congress yours be the responsibility to discuss and to debate them to approve or modify or reject them i welcome your view as i have welcome work with you for year as a colleague and as vice president and president i should like to say to the member of the opposition whose number if i be not mistake seem to have increase somewhat that the genius of the american political system have always be good express through creative debate that offer choice and reasonable alternative throughout our history great republican and democrat have seem to understand this so let there be light and reason in our relation that be the way to a responsible session and a responsive government let us be remember as a president and a congress who try to improve the quality of life for every american not just the rich not just the poor but every man woman and child in this great nation of ours we all go to school to good school or bad school we all take air into our lung clean air or pollute air we all drink water pure water or pollute water we all face sickness someday and some much often than we wish and old age as good we all have a stake in this great society in its economic growth in reduction of civil strife a great stake in good government we just must not arrest the pace of progress we have establish in this country in this year our children's child will pay the price if we be not wise enough and courageous enough and determine enough to stand up and meet the nation's need as good as we can in the time allot us iii abroad as at home there be also risk in change but abroad as at home there be a great risk in stand still no part of our foreign policy be so sacred that it ever remain beyond review we shall be flexible where condition in the world change and where man's effort can change them for the good we be in the midst of a great transition a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a trouble and a threaten planet in latin america the american chief of state will be meet very shortly to give our hemispheric policy new direction we have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter american effort in economic and social development be launch by the conference at bogota in under the leadership of president eisenhower the alliance for progress move dramatically forward under president kennedy there be new confidence that the voice of the people be be hear that the dignity of the individual be strong than ever in this hemisphere and we be face up to and meet many of the hemispheric problem together in this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be make to happen because it have happen so together i think we must now move to strike down the barrier to full cooperation among the american nation and to free the energy and the resource of two great continent on behalf of all of our citizen africa stand at a early stage of development than latin america it have yet to develop the transportation communication agriculture and above all the train man and woman without which growth be impossible there too the job will good be do if the nation and people of africa cooperate on a regional basis much and much our program for africa be go to be direct toward self help the future of africa be shadow by unsolved racial conflict our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitment as a people to support that who be prepare to work towards cooperation and harmony between race and to help that who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence in the middle east the spirit of good will toward all unfortunately have not yet take hold a already torture peace seem to be constantly threaten we shall try to use our influence to increase the possibility of improve relation among the nation of that region we be work hard at that task in the great subcontinent of south asia live much than a 6 of the earth's population over the year we and other have invest very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of india and pakistan we be not prepare to see our assistance waste however in conflict it must strengthen their capacity to help themselves it must help this two nation both our friend to overcome poverty to emerge as self reliant leader and find term for reconciliation and cooperation in western europe we shall maintain in nato a integrate common defense but we also look forward to the time when great security can be achieve through measure of arm control and disarmament and through other form of practical agreement we be shape a new future of enlarge partnership in nuclear affair in economic and technical cooperation in trade negotiation in political consultation and in work together with the government and people of eastern europe and the soviet union the emerge spirit of confidence be precisely what we hope to achieve when we go to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe we face new challenge and opportunity then and there and we face also some danger but i believe that the people on both side of the atlantic as good as both side of this chamber want to face them together our relation with the soviet union and eastern europe be also in transition we have avoid both the act and the rhetoric of the cold war when we have differ with the soviet union or other nation for that matter i have try to differ quietly and with courtesy and without venom our objective be not to continue the cold war but to end it we have reach a agreement at the unite nation on the peaceful use of outer space we have agree to open direct air flight with the soviet union we have remove much than nonstrategic item from export control we be determine that the export import bank can allow commercial credit to poland hungary bulgaria and czechoslovakia as good as to romania and yugoslavia we have enter into a cultural agreement with the soviet union for another year we have agree with bulgaria and hungary to upgrade our legation to embassy we have start discussion with international agency on way of increase contact with eastern european country this administration have take this step even as duty compel us to fulfill and execute alliance and treaty obligation throughout the world that be enter into before i become president so tonight i now ask and urge this congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policy by pass a east west trade bill and by approve our consular convention with the soviet union the soviet union have in the past year increase its long range missile capability it have begin to place near moscow a limit antimissile defense my first responsibility to our people be to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our ally i would emphasize that that be why a important link between russia and the unite state be in our common interest in arm control and in disarmament we have the solemn duty to slow down the arm race between us if that be at all possible in both conventional and nuclear weapon and defense i think we be make some progress in that direction the first few month i be in office i realize that any additional race would impose on our people and on all mankind for that matter a additional waste of resource with no gain in security to either side i expect in the day ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the congress about the possibility of international agreement bear directly upon this problem next to the pursuit of peace the really great challenge to the human family be the race between food supply and population increase that race tonight be be lose the time for rhetoric have clearly pass the time for concerted action be here and we must get on with the job we believe that three principle must prevail if our policy be to succeed first the develop nation must give high priority to food production include the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise 2 nation with food deficit must put much of their resource into voluntary family plan program and 3 the develop nation must all assist other nation to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to fee themselves every member of the world community now bear a direct responsibility to help bring our much basic human account into balance iv i come now finally to southeast asia and to vietnam in particular soon i will submit to the congress a detail report on that situation tonight i want to just review the essential point as briefly as i can we be in vietnam because the unite state of america and our ally be commit by the seato treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in southeast asia we be in vietnam because a international agreement sign by the unite state north vietnam and other in be be systematically violate by the communist that violation threaten the independence of all the small nation in southeast asia and threaten the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world we be there because the people of south vietnam have as much right to remain non communist if that be what they choose as north vietnam have to remain communist we be there because the congress have pledge by solemn vote to take all necessary measure to prevent far aggression no good word can describe our present course than that once speak by the great thomas jefferson it be the melancholy law of human society to be compel sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a great we have choose to fight a limit war in vietnam in a attempt to prevent a large war a war almost certain to follow i believe if the communist succeed in overrun and take over south vietnam by aggression and by force i believe and i be support by some authority that if they be not check now the world can expect to pay a great price to check them late that be what our statesman say when they debate this treaty and that be why it be ratify to by the senate many year ago you will remember that we stand in western europe year ago be there anyone in this chamber tonight who doubt that the course of freedom be not change for the good because of the courage of that stand sixteen year ago we and other stop another kind of aggression this time it be in korea imagine how different asia may be today if we have fail to act when the communist army of north korea march south the asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have say in vietnam as we say year ago in korea this far and no far i think i reveal no secret when i tell you that we be deal with a stubborn adversary who be commit to the use of force and terror to settle political question i wish i can report to you that the conflict be almost over this i cannot do we face much cost much loss and much agony for the end be not yet i cannot promise you that it will come this year or come next year our adversary still believe i think tonight that he can go on fight long than we can and long than we and our ally will be prepare to stand up and resist our man in that area there be nearly now have bear good the burden and the heat of the day their effort have deprive the communist enemy of the victory that he seek and that he expect a year ago we have steadily frustrate his main force general westmoreland report that the enemy can no long succeed on the battlefield so i must say to you that our pressure must be sustain and will be sustain until he realize that the war he start be cost him much than he can ever gain i know of no strategy much likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulate slowly but inexorably every kind of material resource of laboriously teach troop the very element of their trade that and patience and i mean a great deal of patience our south vietnamese ally be also be test tonight because they must provide real security to the people live in the countryside and this mean reduce the terrorism and the arm attack which kidnap and kill civilian in the last month to level where they can be successfully control by the regular south vietnamese security force it mean bring to the villager a effective civilian government that they can respect and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in and that they can have a personal stake in we hope that government be now begin to emerge while i cannot report the desire progress in the pacification effort the very distinguish and able ambassador henry cabot lodge report that south vietnam be turn to this task with a new sense of urgency we can help but only they can win this part of the war their task be to build and protect a new life in each rural province one result of our stand in vietnam be already clear it be this the people of asia now know that the door to independence be not go to be slam shut they know that it be possible for them to choose their own national destiny without coercion the performance of our man in vietnam back by the american people have create a feel of confidence and unity among the independent nation of asia and the pacific i see it in their face in the day that i spend in their home and in their country fear of external communist conquest in many asian nation be already subside and with this the spirit of hope be rise for the first time in history a common outlook and common institution be already emerge this forward movement be root in the ambition and the interest of asian nation themselves it be precisely this movement that we hope to accelerate when i speak at johns hopkins in baltimore in april and i pledge a much much massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world in the hope that we can take some of the fund that we be spend on bullet and bomb and spend it on school and production twenty month late our effort have produce a new reality the door of the billion dollar asian development bank that i recommend to the congress and you endorse almost unanimously i be proud to tell you be already open asian be engage tonight in regional effort in a dozen new direction their hope be high their faith be strong their confidence be deep and even as the war continue we shall play our part in carry forward this constructive historic development as recommend by the eugene black mission and if other nation will join us i will seek a special authorization from the congress of million for east asian regional program we be eager to turn our resource to peace our effort in behalf of humanity i think need not be restrict by any parallel or by any boundary line the moment that peace come as i pledge in baltimore i will ask the congress for fund to join in a international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of vietnam and their deserve neighbor who wish our help we shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of mainland china and the world community include work together in all the task of arm control security and progress on which the fate of the chinese people like their fellow man elsewhere depend we would be the first to welcome a china which decide to respect her neighbor right we would be the first to applaud her be she to apply her great energy and intelligence to improve the welfare of her people and we have no intention of try to deny her legitimate need for security and friendly relation with her neighbor country our hope that all of this will someday happen rest on the conviction that we the american people and our ally will and be go to see vietnam through to a honorable peace we will support all appropriate initiative by the unite nation and other which can bring the several party together for unconditional discussion of peace anywhere any time and we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace until such effort succeed or until the infiltration cease or until the conflict subside i think the course of wisdom for this country be that we just must firmly pursue our present course we will stand firm in vietnam i think you know that our fight man there tonight bear the heavy burden of all with their life they serve their nation we must give them nothing little than our full support and we have give them that nothing little than the determination that american have always give their fight man whatever our sacrifice here even if it be much than a month it be small compare to their own how long it will take i cannot prophesy i only know that the will of the american people i think be tonight be test whether we can fight a war of limit objective over a period of time and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to get it over with be invite but dangerous whether we can accept the necessity of choose a great evil in order to ward off a great whether we can do this without arouse the hatred and the passion that be ordinarily loose in time of war on all this question so much turn the answer will determine not only where we be but whither we be tend a time of test yes and a time of transition the transition be sometimes slow sometimes unpopular almost always very painful and often quite dangerous but we have live with danger for a long time before and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come we know that man be bear unto trouble we also know that this nation be not forge and do not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many man for all the disorder that we must deal with and all the frustration that concern us and all the anxiety that we be call upon to resolve for all the issue we must face with the agony that attend them let us remember that that who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must like man undergo the fatigue of support it but let us also count not only our burden but our blessing for they be many and let us give thank to the one who govern us all let us draw encouragement from the sign of hope for they too be many let us remember that we have be test before and america have never be find want so with your understand i would hope your confidence and your support we be go to persist and we be go to succeed mr speaker mr president member of the congress and my fellow american i be think as i be walk down the aisle tonight of what sam rayburn tell me many year ago the congress always extend a very warm welcome to the president as he come in thank all of you very very much i have come once again to this chamber the home of our democracy to give you as the constitution require information of the state of the union i report to you that our country be challenge at home and abroad that it be our will that be be try not our strength our sense of purpose not our ability to achieve a good america that we have the strength to meet our every challenge the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world and i report to you that i believe with abide conviction that this people nurture by their deep faith tutor by their hard lesson move by their high aspiration have the will to meet the trial that this time impose since i report to you last january three election have be hold in vietnam in the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence a president a vice president a house and senate and village official have be choose by popular contest ballot the enemy have be defeat in battle after battle the numb of south vietnamese live in area under government protection tonight have grow by much than a million since january of last year this be all mark of progress yet the enemy continue to pour man and material across frontier and into battle despite his continuous heavy loss he continue to hope that america's will to persevere can be break good he be wrong america will persevere our patience and our perseverance will match our power aggression will never prevail but our goal be peace and peace at the early possible moment right now we be explore the mean of hanoi's recent statement there be no mystery about the question which must be answer before the bomb be stop we believe that any talk should follow the san antonio formula that i state last september which say the bomb would stop immediately if talk would take place promptly and with reasonable hope that they would be productive and the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past this nation simply cannot accept anything little without jeopardize the life of our man and of our ally if a basis for peace talk can be establish on the san antonio foundation and it be my hope and my prayer that they can we would consult with our ally and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostility a really true cease fire can be make the first order of business i will report at the early possible moment the result of this exploration to the american people i have just recently return from a very fruitful visit and talk with his holiness the pope and i share his hope as he express it early today that both side will extend themselves in a effort to bring a end to the war in vietnam i have today assure him that we and our ally will do our full part to bring this about since i speak to you last january other event have occur that have major consequence for world peace the kennedy round achieve the great reduction in tariff barrier in all the history of trade negotiation the nation of latin america at punta del este resolve to move toward economic integration in asia the nation from korea and japan to indonesia and singapore work behind america's shield to strengthen their economy and to broaden their political cooperation in africa from which the distinguish vice president have just return he report to me that there be a spirit of regional cooperation that be begin to take hold in very practical way this event we all welcome yet since i last report to you we and the world have be confront by a numb of crisis during the arab israeli war last june the hot line between washington and moscow be use for the first time in our history a cease fire be achieve without a major power confrontation now the nation of the middle east have the opportunity to cooperate with ambassador jarring's u.n mission and they have the responsibility to find the term of live together in stable peace and dignity and we shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result not far from this scene of conflict a crisis flare on cyprus involve two people who be america's friend greece and turkey our very able representative mr cyrus vance and other help to ease this tension turmoil continue on the mainland of china after a year of violent disruption the radical extremism of their government have isolate the chinese people behind their own border the unite state however remain will to permit the travel of journalist to both our country to undertake cultural and educational exchange and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop material since i speak to you last the unite state and the soviet union have take several important step toward the goal of international cooperation as you will remember i meet with chairman kosygin at glassboro and we achieve if not accord at less a clear understand of our respective position after day of meet because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrow we have work with the soviet union and with other nation to reach a agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapon on the basis of communication from ambassador fisher in geneva this afternoon i be encourage to believe that a draft treaty can be lay before the conference in geneva in the very near future i hope to be able to present that treaty to the senate this year for the senate's approval we achieve in a consular treaty with the soviet the first commercial air agreement between the two country and a treaty ban weapon in outer space we shall sign and submit to the senate shortly a new treaty with the soviet and with other for the protection of astronaut serious difference still remain between us yet in this relation we have make some progress since vienna the berlin wall and the cuban missile crisis but despite this progress we must maintain a military force that be capable of deter any threat to this nation's security whatever the mode of aggression our choice must not be confine to total war or to total acquiescence we have such a military force today we shall maintain it i wish with all of my heart that the expenditure that be necessary to build and to protect our power can all be devote to the program of peace but until world condition permit and until peace be assure america's may and america's brave son who wear our nation's uniform must continue to stand guard for all of us as they gallantly do tonight in vietnam and other place in the world yet neither great weapon nor individual courage can provide the condition of peace for two decade america have commit itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threaten the peace we shall sustain that commitment this year i shall propose that we launch with other nation a exploration of the ocean depth to tap its wealth and its energy and its abundance that we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the international development association and to increase the resource of the asian development bank that we adopt a prudent aid program root in the principle of self help that we renew and extend the food for freedom program our food program have already help million avoid the horror of famine but unless the rapid growth of population in develop country be slow the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily government in the develop country must take such fact into consideration we in the unite state be prepare to help assist them in that effort but we must also improve the life of child already bear in the village and town and city on this earth they can be teach by great teacher through space communication and the miracle of satellite television and we be go to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true let me speak now about some matter here at home tonight our nation be accomplish much for its people than have ever be accomplish before american be prosperous as man have never be in record history yet there be in the land a certain restlessness a question the total of our nation's annual production be now above billion for month this nation have be on a steady upward trend of growth all about them much american family can see the evidence of grow abundance high paycheck hum factory new car move down new highway much and much family own their own home equip with much than million television set a new college be found every week today much than half of the high school graduate go on to college there be hundred of thousand of father and mother who never complete grammar school who will see their child graduate from college why then this restlessness because when a great ship cut through the sea the water be always stir and trouble and our ship be move it be move through trouble and new water it be move toward new and good shore we ask now not how can we achieve abundance but how shall we use our abundance not be there abundance enough for all but how can all share in our abundance while we have accomplish much much remain for us to meet and much remain for us to master in some area the jobless rate be still three or four time the national average violence have show its face in some of our city crime increase on our street income for farm worker remain far behind that for urban worker and parity for our farmer who produce our food be still just a hope not a achievement new house construction be far little than we need to assure decent shelter for every family hospital and medical cost be high and they be rise many river and the air in many city remain badly pollute and our citizen suffer from breathe that air we have live with condition like this for many many year but much that we once accept as inevitable we now find absolutely intolerable in our city last summer we see how wide be the gulf for some american between the promise and the reality of our society we know that we cannot change all of this in a day it represent the bitter consequence of much than three century but the issue be not whether we can change this the issue be whether we will change this good i know we can and i believe we will this then be the work we should do in the month that be ahead of us in this congress the first essential be much job useful job for ten of thousand who can become productive and can pay their own way our economy have create million new job in the past year it be add much than a million and a half new job this year through program pass by the congress job train be be give tonight to much than a million american in this country this year the time have come when we must get to that who be last in line the hard core unemployed the hard to reach employment official estimate that of this person be now unemployed in the major city of america our objective be to place this in private industry job within the next year to do this i propose a billion manpower program in the come fiscal year a percent increase over the current year much of this increase will be use to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard core unemployed person i know of no task before us of much importance to us to the country or to our future another essential be to rebuild our city last year the congress authorize million for the model city program i request the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the city of america but the congress appropriate only million little than half this year i urge the congress to honor my request for model city fund to rebuild the center of american city by grant us the

some cloud on the horizon price be rise interest rate have pass the peak of and if there be continue inaction on the tax bill they will climb even high i warn the congress and the nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep us into a accelerate spiral of price increase a slump in homebuilding and a continue erosion of the american dollar this would be a tragedy for every american family and i predict that if this happen they will all let us know about it we that of us in the executive branch in the congress and the leader of labor and business must do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune under the new budget the expenditure for will increase by billion receipt will increase by billion include the add tax revenue virtually all of this expenditure increase represent the mandatory cost of our defense effort billion increase interest almost billion or mandatory payment under law pass by congress such as that provide in the social security act that you pass in and to medicare and medicaid beneficiary veteran and farmer of about billion and the additional billion million next year for the pay increase that you pass in military and civilian pay that make up the billion that be add to the budget with few exception very few we be hold the fiscal budget to last year's level outside of that mandatory and require increase a presidential commission compose of distinguish congressional fiscal leader and other prominent american recommend this year that we adopt a new budget approach i be carry out their recommendation in this year's budget this budget therefore for the first time accurately cover all federal expenditure and all federal receipt include for the first time in one budget billion from the social security medicare highway and other trust fund the fiscal budget have expenditure of approximately billion with total estimate revenue include the tax bill of about billion if the congress enact the tax increase we will reduce the budget deficit by some billion the war in vietnam be cost us about billion and we be ask for about billion in tax and if we get that billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about billion in to about billion in now this be a tight budget it follow the reduction that i make in cooperation with the congress a reduction make after you have review every appropriation bill and reduce the appropriation by some or billion and expenditure by billion we confer together and i recommend to the congress and you subsequently approve take percent from payroll and percent from controllable expenditure we therefore reduce appropriation almost billion last session and expenditure over billion now that be in the budget last year i ask the congress to recognize that there be certain select program that meet the nation's much urgent need and they have increase we have insist that decrease in very desirable but little urgent program be make before we would approve any increase so i ask the congress tonight to hold its appropriation to the budget request and to act responsibly early this year by enact the tax surcharge which for the average american individual amount to about a penny out of each dollar's income this tax increase would yield about half of the billion per year that we return to the people in the tax reduction bill of and this must be a temporary measure which expire in little than year congress can repeal it soon if the need have pass but congress can never repeal inflation the leader of american business and the leader of american labor that who really have power over wage and price must act responsibly and in their nation's interest by keep increase in line with productivity if our recognize leader do not do this they and that for whom they speak and all of us be go to suffer very serious consequence on january 1st i outline a program to reduce our balance of payment deficit sharply this year we will ask the congress to help carry out that part of the program which require legislation we must restore equilibrium to our balance of payment we must also strengthen the international monetary system we have assure the world that america's full gold stock stand behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at a ounce we must back this commitment by legislate now to free our gold reserve american travel much than any other people in history take billion out of their country last year in travel cost we must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of much than billion we be hope that we can reduce it by million without unduly penalize the travel of teacher student business people who have essential and necessary travel or people who have relative abroad whom they want to see even with this reduction of million the american people will still be travel much overseas than they do in or or any other year in their history if we act together as i hope we can i believe we can continue our economic expansion which have already break all past record and i hope that we can continue that expansion in the day ahead each of this question i have discuss with you tonight be a question of policy for our people therefore each of them should be and doubtless will be debate by candidate for public office this year i hope that debate will be mark by new proposal and by a seriousness that match the gravity of the question themselves this be not appropriate subject for narrow partisan oratory they go to the heart of what we american be all about all of us democrat and republican tonight i have speak of some of the goal i should like to see america reach many of them can be achieve this year other by the time we celebrate our nation's 200th birthday the bicentennial of our independence several of this goal be go to be very hard to reach but the state of our union will be much strong year from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach this goal now they be much important much much important than the identity of the party or the president who will then be in office this goal be what the fight and our alliance be really mean to protect can we achieve this goal of course we can if we will if ever there be a people who seek much than mere abundance it be our people if ever there be a nation that be capable of solve its problem it be this nation if ever there be a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of be a american it be this time so this my friend be the state of our union seek build test many time in this past year and always equal to the test thank you and good night for the 6 and the last time i present to the congress my assessment of the state of the union i shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity and about the commitment that all of us have make together that will if we carry them out give america our good chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want every president life not only with what be but with what have be and what can be much of the great event in his presidency be part of a large sequence extend back through several year and extend back through several other administration urban unrest poverty pressure on welfare education of our people law enforcement and law and order the continue crisis in the middle east the conflict in vietnam the danger of nuclear war the great difficulty of deal with the communist power all have this much in common they and their cause the cause that give rise to them all of this have exist with us for many year several president have already seek to try to deal with them one or much president will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the year that be ahead of us but if the nation's problem be continue so be this great nation's asset our economy the democratic system our sense of exploration symbolize much recently by the wonderful flight of the apollo in which all american take great pride the good commonsense and sound judgment of the american people and their essential love of justice we must not ignore our problem but neither should we ignore our strength that strength be available to sustain a president of either party to support his progressive effort both at home and overseas unfortunately the departure of a administration do not mean the end of the problem that this administration have face the effort to meet the problem must go on year after year if the momentum that we have all mount together in this past year be not to be lose although the struggle for progressive change be continuous there be time when a watershed be reach when there be if not really a break with the past at less the fulfillment of many of its old hope and a step forth into a new environment to seek new goal i think the past year have be such a time we have finish a major part of the old agendum some of the law that we write have already in front of our eye take on the flesh of achievement medicare that we be unable to pass for so many year be now a part of american life vote right and the vote booth that we debate so long back in the riffle and the door to public service be open at last to all american regardless of their color school and school child all over america tonight be receive federal assistance to go to good school preschool education head start be already here to stay and i think so be the federal program that tonight be keep much than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the college and the university of this country part of the american earth not only in description on a map but in the reality of our shore our hill our park our forest and our mountain have be permanently set aside for the american public and for their benefit and there be much that will be set aside before this administration end five million american have be train for job in new federal program i think it be much important that we all realize tonight that this nation be close to full employment with little unemployment than we have have at any time in almost year that be not in theory that be in fact tonight the unemployment rate be down to percent the numb of job have grow much than million in the last year that be much than in all the precede year this achievement complete the full cycle from idea to enactment and finally to a place in the life of citizen all across this country i wish it be possible to say that everything that this congress and the administration achieve during this period have already complete that cycle but a great deal of what we have commit need additional fund to become a tangible realization yet the very existence of this commitment this promise to the american people make by this congress and by the executive branch of the government be achievement in themselves and failure to carry through on our commitment would be a tragedy for this nation this much be certain no one man or group of man make this commitment alone congress and the executive branch with their check and balance reason together and finally write them into the law of the land they now have all the moral force that the american political system can summon when it act as one they express america's common determination to achieve goal they imply action in much case you have already begin that action but it be not fully complete of course let me speak for a moment about this commitment i be go to speak in the language which the congress itself speak when it pass this measure i be go to quote from your word in congress declare that improve the quality of urban life be the much critical domestic problem face the unite state two year late it affirm the historic goal of a decent home for every american family that be your language now to meet this commitment we must increase our support for the model city program where blueprint of change be already be prepare in much than american city to achieve the goal of the house act of that you have already pass we should begin this year much than home for needy family in the come fiscal year fund be provide in the new budget to do just this this be almost time time the average rate of the past year our city and our town be be press for fund to meet the need of their grow population so i believe a urban development bank should be create by the congress this bank can obtain resource through the issuance of taxable bond and it can then lend this resource at reduce rate to the community throughout the land for school hospital park and other public facility since we enact the social security act back in congress have recognize the necessity to make much adequate provision for age person through maternal and child welfare and public health that be the word of the congress much adequate the time have come i think to make it much adequate i believe we should increase social security benefit and i be so recommend tonight i be suggest that there should be a overall increase in benefit of at less percent that who receive only the minimum of should get a month our nation too be rightfully proud of our medical advance but we should remember that our country rank 15th among the nation of the world in its infant mortality rate i think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their child during the first year of their life in the unite state of america i think we should protect our child and their family from the cost of catastrophic illness as we pass on from medicine i think nothing be clear to the congress than the commitment that the congress make to end poverty congress express it good i think in when they say it be the policy of the unite state to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation this be the rich nation in the world the antipoverty program have have many achievement it also have some failure but we must not cripple it after only year of try to solve the human problem that have be with us and have be build up among us for generation i believe the congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganize portion of it and transfer them to other agency i believe though it will want to continue until we have break the back of poverty the effort we be now make throughout this land i believe and i hope the next administration i believe they believe that the key to success in this effort be job it be work for people who want to work in the budget for fiscal i shall recommend a total of billion for our job train program and that be five time as much as we spend in try to prepare american where they can work to earn their own live the nation's commitment in the field of civil right begin with the declaration of independence they be extend by the 13th 14th and 15th amendment they have be powerfully strengthen by the enactment of three far reach civil right law within the past year that this congress in its wisdom pass on january of this year the fair house act of cover over million american home and apartment the prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remember and it should be vigorously enforce throughout this land i believe we should also extend the vital provision of the vote right act for another year in the safe street act of congress determine to assist state and local government in reduce the incidence of crime this year i be propose that the congress provide the full million that the congress last year authorize to do just that i hope the congress will put the money where the authorization be i believe this be a essential contribution to justice and to public order in the unite state i hope this grant can be make to the state and they can be use effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country but all of this be only a small part of the total effort that must be make i think chiefly by the local government throughout the nation if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest frankly as i leave the office of the presidency one of my great disappointment be our failure to secure passage of a license and registration act for firearm i think if we have pass that act it would have reduce the incidence of crime i believe that the congress should adopt such a law and i hope that it will at a not too distant date in order to meet our long stand commitment to make government as efficient as possible i believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the line of the report 1frederick r kappel chairman of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salary i hope we can all agree that public service should never impose a unreasonable financial sacrifice on able man and woman who want to serve their country i believe that the recommendation of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salary be generally sound late this week i shall submit a special message which i review with the leadership this even contain a proposal that have be reduce and have modify the commission's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salary for member of congress i will recommend the basic compensation not of the unanimously recommend by the kappel commission and the other distinguish member but i shall reduce that to i will suggest that congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expense so that member will not be require to use their salary increase for essential official business i would have submit the commission's recommendation except the advice that i receive from the leadership and you usually be consult about matter that affect the congress be that the congress would not accept the recommendation and if i expect my recommendation to be seriously consider i should make substantial reduction that be the only reason i didn't go along with the kappel report in recommend to the congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft i submit it again tonight for your much respectful consideration i know that all of us recognize that much of the thing we do to meet all of this commitment i talk about will cost money if we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have have in this country for the past year i think we shall generate the resource that we need to meet this commitment we have already be able to increase our support for major social program although we have hear a lot about not be able to do anything on the home front because of vietnam but we have be able in the last year to increase our commitment for such thing as health and education from billion in to billion in the come fiscal year that be much than double that be much than it have ever be increase in the year of this republic notwithstanding vietnam we must continue to budget our resource and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar great revenue and the reduce federal spend require by congress last year have change the budgetary picture dramatically since last january when we make our estimate at that time you will remember that we estimate we would have a deficit of billion good i be glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year end june this june we be go to have not a deficit but we be go to have a billion surplus you will receive the budget tomorrow the budget for the next fiscal year that begin july which you will want to examine very carefully in the day ahead will provide a billion surplus this budget anticipate the extension of the surtax that congress enact last year i have communicate with the president elect mr nixon in connection with this policy of continue the surtax for the time be i want to tell you that both of us want to see it remove just as soon as circumstance will permit but the president elect have tell me that he have conclude that until his administration and this congress can examine the appropriation bill and each item in the budget and can ascertain that the fact justify permit the surtax to expire or to be reduce he mr nixon will support my recommendation that the surtax be continue american i believe be unite in the hope that the paris talk will bring a early peace to vietnam and if our hope for a early settlement of the war be realize then our military expenditure can be reduce and very substantial saving can be make to be use for other desirable purpose as the congress may determine in any event i think it be imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintain our prosperity i think all american know that our prosperity be broad and it be deep and it have bring record profit the high in our history and record wage our gross national product have grow much in the last year than any other period in our nation's history our wage have be the high our profit have be the good this prosperity have enable million to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise have the last few year i think also you will be very glad to hear that the secretary of the treasury inform me tonight that in in our balance of payment we have achieve a surplus it appear that we have in fact do good this year than we have do in any year in this regard since the year the quest for a durable peace i think have absorb every administration since the end of world war ii it have require us to seek a limitation of arm race not only among the superpower but among the small nation as good we have join in the test ban treaty of the outer space treaty of and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapon in this latter agreement the nonproliferation treaty be now pend in the senate and it have be pend there since last july in my opinion delay in ratify it be not go to be helpful to the cause of peace america take the lead in negotiate this treaty and america should now take step to have it approve at the early possible date until a way can be find to scale down the level of arm among the superpower mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension so i believe that we should resume the talk with the soviet union about limit offensive and defensive missile system i think they would already have be resume except for czechoslovakia and our election this year it be much than year ago that we embark on a program of try to aid the develop nation we know then that we can not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on a earth that be seethe in misery during this year there have be great advance make under our program particularly against want and hunger although we be disappoint at the appropriation last year we think they be woefully inadequate this year i be ask for adequate fund for economic assistance in the hope that we can far peace throughout the world i think we must continue to support effort in regional cooperation among that effort that of western europe have a very special place in america's concern the only course that be go to permit europe to play the great world role that its resource permit be to go forward to unity i think america remain ready to work with a unite europe to work as a partner on the basis of equality for the future the quest for peace i believe require that we maintain the liberal trade policy that have help us become the lead nation in world trade that we strengthen the international monetary system as a instrument of world prosperity and that we seek area of agreement with the soviet union where the interest of both nation and the interest of world peace be properly serve the strain relationship between us and the world's lead communist power have not end especially in the light of the brutal invasion of czechoslovakia but totalitarianism be no little odious to us because we be able to reach some accommodation that reduce the danger of world catastrophe what we do we do in the interest of peace in the world we earnestly hope that time will bring a russia that be little afraid of diversity and individual freedom the quest for peace tonight continue in vietnam and in the paris talk i regret much than any of you know that it have not be possible to restore peace to south vietnam the prospect i think for peace be good today than at any time since north vietnam begin its invasion with its regular force much than year ago the free nation of asia know what they be not sure of at that time that america care about their freedom and it also care about america's own vital interest in asia and throughout the pacific the north vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purpose by force there may be hard fight before a settlement be reach but i can assure you it will yield no victory to the communist cause i cannot speak to you tonight about vietnam without pay a very personal tribute to the man who have carry the battle out there for all of us i have be honor to be their commander in chief the nation owe them its unstinting support while the battle continue and its endure gratitude when their service be do finally the quest for stable peace in the middle east go on in many capital tonight america fully support the unanimous resolution of the u.n security council which point the way there must be a settlement of the arm hostility that exist in that region of the world today it be a threat not only to israel and to all the arab state but it be a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as good now my friend in congress i want to conclude with a few very personal word to you i reject and reject and then finally accept the congressional leadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight i do that for two reason one be philosophical i want to give you my judgment as i see it on some of the issue before our nation as i view them before i leave the other be just pure sentimental much all of my life as a public official have be spend here in this build for year since i work on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the house of representative i have know this hall and i have know much of the man pretty good who walk them i know the question that you face i know the conflict that you endure i know the ideal that you seek to serve i leave here first to become vice president and then to become in a moment of tragedy the president of the unite state my term of office have be mark by a series of challenge both at home and throughout the world in meet some of this challenge the nation have find a new confidence in meet other it know turbulence and doubt and fear and hate throughout this time i have be sustain by my faith in representative democracy a faith that i have learn here in this capitol build as a employee and as a congressman and as a senator i believe deeply in the ultimate purpose of this nation describe by the constitution temper by history embody in progressive law and give life by man and woman that have be elect to serve their fellow citizen now for much demand year in the white house i have be strengthen by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former president harry s truman and dwight david eisenhower i have be guide by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved john f kennedy and with our great modern legislator speaker sam rayburn i have be assist by my friend every step of the way vice president hubert humphrey i be so grateful that i have be support daily by the loyalty of speaker mccormack and majority leader albert i have benefit from the wisdom of senator mike mansfield and i be sure that i have avoid many dangerous pitfall by the good commonsense counsel of the president pro tem of the senate senator richard brevard russell i have receive the much generous cooperation from the leader of the republican party in the congress of the unite state senator dirksen and congressman gerald ford the minority leader no president should ask for much although i do upon occasion but few president have ever be bless with so much president elect nixon in the day ahead be go to need your understand just as i do and he be entitle to have it i hope every member will remember that the burden he will bear as our president will be bear for all of us each of us should try not to increase this burden for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage now it be time to leave i hope it may be say a hundred year from now that by work together we help to make our country much just much just for all of its people as good as to insure and guarantee the blessing of liberty for all of our posterity that be what i hope but i believe that at less it will be say that we try
