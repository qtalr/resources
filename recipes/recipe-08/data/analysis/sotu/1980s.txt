mr president mr speaker member of the 96th congress fellow citizen this last few month have not be a easy time for any of us as we meet tonight it have never be much clear that the state of our union depend on the state of the world and tonight as throughout our own generation freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our union the s have be bear in turmoil strife and change this be a time of challenge to our interest and our value and it's a time that test our wisdom and our skill at this time in iran american be still hold captive innocent victim of terrorism and anarchy also at this moment massive soviet troop be attempt to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of afghanistan this two act one of international terrorism and one of military aggression present a serious challenge to the unite state of america and indeed to all the nation of the world together we will meet this threat to peace i'm determine that the unite state will remain the strong of all nation but our power will never be use to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the right of any human be we seek to be and to remain secure a nation at peace in a stable world but to be secure we must face the world as it be three basic development have help to shape our challenge the steady growth and increase projection of soviet military power beyond its own border the overwhelm dependence of the western democracy on oil supply from the middle east and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nation of the develop world exemplify by the revolution in iran each of this factor be important in its own right each interact with the other all must be face together squarely and courageously we will face this challenge and we will meet them with the good that be in us and we will not fail in response to the abhorrent act in iran our nation have never be arouse and unify so greatly in peacetime our position be clear the unite state will not yield to blackmail we continue to pursue this specific goal first to protect the present and long range interest of the unite state secondly to preserve the life of the american hostage and to secure as quickly as possible their safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which may far endanger the life of our fellow citizen to enlist the help of other nation in condemn this act of violence which be shock and violate the moral and the legal standard of a civilize world and also to convince and to persuade the iranian leader that the real danger to their nation lie in the north in the soviet union and from the soviet troop now in afghanistan and that the unwarranted iranian quarrel with the unite state hamper their response to this far great danger to them if the american hostage be harm a severe price will be pay we will never rest until every one of the american hostage be release but now we face a broad and much fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the soviet union now as during the last decade the relationship between our country the unite state of america and the soviet union be the much critical factor in determine whether the world will live at peace or be engulf in global conflict since the end of the 2 world war america have lead other nation in meet the challenge of mount soviet power this have not be a simple or a static relationship between us there have be cooperation there have be competition and at time there have be confrontation in the s we take the lead in create the atlantic alliance in response to the soviet union's suppression and then consolidation of its east european empire and the result threat of the warsaw pact to western europe in the s we help to contain far soviet challenge in korea and in the middle east and we rearm to assure the continuation of that containment in the s we meet the soviet challenge in berlin and we face the cuban missile crisis and we seek to engage the soviet union in the important task of move beyond the cold war and away from confrontation and in the s three american president negotiate with the soviet leader in attempt to halt the growth of the nuclear arm race we seek to establish rule of behavior that would reduce the risk of conflict and we search for area of cooperation that can make our relation reciprocal and productive not only for the sake of our two nation but for the security and peace of the entire world in all this action we have maintain two commitment to be ready to meet any challenge by soviet military power and to develop way to resolve dispute and to keep the peace prevent nuclear war be the foremost responsibility of the two superpower that's why we've negotiate the strategic arm limitation treaty salt i and salt ii especially now in a time of great tension observe the mutual constraint impose by the term of this treaty will be in the good interest of both country and will help to preserve world peace i will consult very closely with the congress on this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapon that effort to control nuclear weapon will not be abandon we superpower also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force the integrity and the independence of weak nation must not be threaten they must know that in our presence they be secure but now the soviet union have take a radical and a aggressive new step it's use its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation the implication of the soviet invasion of afghanistan can pose the much serious threat to the peace since the 2 world war the vast majority of nation on earth have condemn this late soviet attempt to extend its colonial domination of other and have demand the immediate withdrawal of soviet troop the moslem world be especially and justifiably outrage by this aggression against a islamic people no action of a world power have ever be so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemn but verbal condemnation be not enough the soviet union must pay a concrete price for their aggression while this invasion continue we and the other nation of the world cannot conduct business as usual with the soviet union that's why the unite state have impose stiff economic penalty on the soviet union i will not issue any permit for soviet ship to fish in the coastal water of the unite state i've cut soviet access to high technology equipment and to agricultural product i've limit other commerce with the soviet union and i've ask our ally and friend to join with us in restrain their own trade with the soviet and not to replace our own embargo item and i have notify the olympic committee that with soviet invade force in afghanistan neither the american people nor i will support send a olympic team to moscow the soviet union be go to have to answer some basic question will it help promote a much stable international environment in which its own legitimate peaceful concern can be pursue or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security need and use that power for colonial conquest the soviet union must realize that its decision to use military force in afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it value the region which be now threaten by soviet troop in afghanistan be of great strategic importance it contain much than two third of the world's exportable oil the soviet effort to dominate afghanistan have bring soviet military force to within mile of the indian ocean and close to the strait of hormuz a waterway through which much of the world's oil must flow the soviet union be now attempt to consolidate a strategic position therefore that pose a grave threat to the free movement of middle east oil this situation demand careful think steady nerve and resolute action not only for this year but for many year to come it demand collective effort to meet this new threat to security in the persian gulf and in southwest asia it demand the participation of all that who rely on oil from the middle east and who be concern with global peace and stability and it demand consultation and close cooperation with country in the area which may be threaten meet this challenge will take national will diplomatic and political wisdom economic sacrifice and of course military capability we must call on the good that be in us to preserve the security of this crucial region let our position be absolutely clear a attempt by any outside force to gain control of the persian gulf region will be regard as a assault on the vital interest of the unite state of america and such a assault will be repel by any mean necessary include military force during the past year you have join with me to improve our own security and the prospect for peace not only in the vital oil produce area of the persian gulf region but around the world we've increase annually our real commitment for defense and we will sustain this increase of effort throughout the five year defense program it's imperative that congress approve this strong defense budget for encompass a percent real growth in authorization without any reduction we be also improve our capability to deploy u.s military force rapidly to distant area we've help to strengthen nato and our other alliance and recently we and other nato member have decide to develop and to deploy modernize intermediate range nuclear force to meet a unwarranted and increase threat from the nuclear weapon of the soviet union we be work with our ally to prevent conflict in the middle east the peace treaty between egypt and israel be a notable achievement which represent a strategic asset for america and which also enhance prospect for regional and world peace we be now engage in far negotiation to provide full autonomy for the people of the west bank and gaza to resolve the palestinian issue in all its aspect and to preserve the peace and security of israel let no one doubt our commitment to the security of israel in a few day we will observe a historic event when israel make another major withdrawal from the sinai and when ambassador will be exchange between israel and egypt we've also expand our own sphere of friendship our deep commitment to human right and to meet human need have improve our relationship with much of the 3 world our decision to normalize relation with the people's republic of china will help to preserve peace and stability in asia and in the western pacific we've increase and strengthen our naval presence in the indian ocean and we be now make arrangement for key naval and air facility to be use by our force in the region of northeast africa and the persian gulf we've reconfirm our agreement to help pakistan preserve its independence and its integrity the unite state will take action consistent with our own law to assist pakistan in resist any outside aggression and i'm ask the congress specifically to reaffirm this agreement i'm also work along with the leader of other nation to provide additional military and economic aid for pakistan that request will come to you in just a few day in the week ahead we will far strengthen political and military tie with other nation in the region we believe that there be no irreconcilable difference between us and any

force be adequate for current defense need and i hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft however we must be prepare for that possibility for this reason i have determine that the selective service system must now be revitalize i will send legislation and budget proposal to the congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet future mobilization need rapidly if they arise we also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agency we will guarantee that abuse do not recur but we must tighten our control on sensitive intelligence information and we need to remove unwarranted restraint on america's ability to collect intelligence the decade ahead will be a time of rapid change as nation everywhere seek to deal with new problem and age old tension but america need have no fear we can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our value and actively engage in promote world peace we will continue to work as we have for peace in the middle east and southern africa we will continue to build our tie with develop nation respect and help to strengthen their national independence which they have struggle so hard to achieve and we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection of human right in repressive regime popular frustration often have no outlet except through violence but when people and their government can approach their problem together through open democratic method the basis for stability and peace be far much solid and far much endure that be why our support for human right in other country be in our own national interest as good as part of our own national character peace a peace that preserve freedom remain america's first goal in the come year as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace but to be strong abroad we must be strong at home and in order to be strong we must continue to face up to the difficult issue that confront us as a nation today the crisis in iran and afghanistan have dramatize a very important lesson our excessive dependence on foreign oil be a clear and present danger to our nation's security the need have never be much urgent at long last we must have a clear comprehensive energy policy for the unite state as you good know i have be work with the congress in a concentrate and persistent way over the past year to meet this need we have make progress together but congress must act promptly now to complete final action on this vital energy legislation our nation will then have a major conservation effort important initiative to develop solar power realistic price base on the true value of oil strong incentive for the production of coal and other fossil fuel in the unite state and our nation's much massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic fuel the american people be make progress in energy conservation last year we reduce overall petroleum consumption by percent and gasoline consumption by percent below what it be the year before now we must do much after consultation with the governor we will set gasoline conservation goal for each of the state and i will make them mandatory if this goal be not meet i've establish a import ceil for of million barrel a day good below the level of foreign oil purchase in i expect our import to be much low than this but the ceil will be enforce by a oil import fee if necessary i'm prepare to low this import still far if the other oil consume country will join us in a fair and mutual reduction if we have a serious shortage i will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline ration immediately the single big factor in the inflation rate last year the increase in the inflation rate last year be from one cause the skyrocket price of opec oil we must take whatever action be necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and at the same time reduce inflation as individual and as family few of us can produce energy by ourselves but all of us can conserve energy every one of us every day of our life tonight i call on you in fact all the people of america to help our nation conserve energy eliminate waste make indeed a year of energy conservation of course we must take other action to strengthen our nation's economy first we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the federal budget 2 as we continue to work with business to hold down price we'll build also on the historic national accord with organize labor to restrain pay increase in a fair fight against inflation

and of brave achievement thank you very much mr speaker mr president distinguish member of congress honor guest and fellow citizen only a month ago i be your guest in this historic build and i pledge to you my cooperation in do what be right for this nation that we all love so much i'm here tonight to reaffirm that pledge and to ask that we share in restore the promise that be offer to every citizen by this the last good hope of man on earth all of us be aware of the punish inflation which have for the first time in year hold to double digit figure for year in a row interest rate have reach absurd level of much that percent and over percent for that who would borrow to buy a home all across this land one can see newly build home stand vacant unsold because of mortgage interest rate almost million american be out of work this be people who want to be productive but as the month go by despair dominate their life the threat of layoff and unemployment hang over other million and all who work be frustrate by their inability to keep up with inflation one worker in a midwest city put it to me this way he say i'm bring home much dollar than i ever believe i can possibly earn but i seem to be get bad off and he be not only have hourly earnings of the american worker after adjust for inflation decline percent over the past year but in this year federal personal tax for the average family have increase percent we can no long procrastinate and hope that thing will get good they will not unless we act forcefully and now the economy will get bad can we who man the ship of state deny it be somewhat out of control our national debt be approach trillion a few week ago i call such a figure a trillion dollar incomprehensible and i've be try ever since to think of a way to illustrate how big a trillion really be and the good i can come up with be that if you have a stack of thousand dollar bill in your hand only inch high you'd be a millionaire a trillion dollar would be a stack of thousand dollar bill mile high the interest on the public debt this year we know will be over billion and unless we change the propose spend for the fiscal year begin october 1st we'll add another almost billion to the debt add to our trouble be a mass of regulation impose on the shopkeeper the farmer the craftsman professional and major industry that be estimate to add billion to the price of the thing we buy and it reduce our ability to produce the rate of increase in american productivity once one of the high in the world be among the low of all major industrial nation indeed it have actually decline in the last year now i've paint a pretty grim picture but i think i've paint it accurately it be within our power to change this picture and we can act with hope there's nothing wrong with our internal strength there have be no breakdown of the human technological and natural resource upon which the economy be build base on this confidence in a system which have never fail us but which we have fail through a lack of confidence and sometimes through a belief that we can fine tune the economy and get it tune to our like i be propose a comprehensive four point program now let me outline in detail some of the principal part of this program you'll each be provide with a completely detail copy of the entire program this plan be aim at reduce the growth in government spend and tax reform and eliminate regulation which be unnecessary and unproductive or counterproductive and encourage a consistent monetary policy aim at maintain the value of the currency if enact in full this program can help america create million new job nearly million much than we would have without this measure it will also help us to gain control of inflation it's important to note that we're only reduce the rate of increase in tax and spend we're not attempt to cut either spend or tax level below that which we presently have this plan will get our economy move again create productivity growth and thus create the job that our people must have and i'm ask that you join me in reduce direct federal spend by billion in fiscal year and this go along with another billion in user fee and off budget saving for a total of billion and this will still allow a increase of billion over spend now i know that exaggerate and inaccurate story about this cut have disturb many people particularly that dependent on grant and benefit program for their basic need some of you have hear from constituent i know afraid that social security check for example be go to be take away from them good i regret the fear that this unfounded story have cause and i welcome this opportunity to set thing straight we will continue to fulfill the obligation that spring from our national conscience that who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty strike the disable the elderly all that with true need can rest assure that the social safety net of program they depend on be exempt from any cut the full retirement benefit of the much than million social security recipient will be continue along with a annual cost of live increase medicare will not be cut nor will supplemental income for the blind the age and the disable and fund will continue for veteran pension school breakfast and lunch for the child of low income family will continue as will nutrition and other special service for the age there will be no cut in project head start or summer youth job all in all nearly billion worth of program provide help for ten of million of american will be fully fund but government will not continue to subsidize individual or particular business interest where real need cannot be demonstrate and while we will reduce some subsidy to regional and local government we will at the same time convert a numb of categorical grant program into block grant to reduce wasteful administrative overhead and to give local government and state much flexibility and control we call for a end in duplication to federal program and reform of that which be not cost effective now already some have protest that there must be no reduction in aid to school good let me point out that federal aid to education amount to only percent of the total educational fund and for this percent the federal government have insist on tremendously disproportionate share of control over our school whatever reduction we've propose in that percent will amount to very little in the total cost of education they will however restore much authority to state and local school district historically the american people have support by voluntary contribution much artistic and cultural activity than all the other country in the world put together i wholeheartedly support this approach and believe that american will continue their generosity therefore i'm propose a saving of million in the federal subsidy now go to the art and humanity there be a numb of subsidy to business and industry that i believe be unnecessary not because the activity be subsidize aren't of value but because the marketplace contain incentive enough to warrant continue this activity without a government subsidy one such subsidy be the department of energy's synthetic fuel program we will continue support of research lead to development of new technology and much independence from foreign oil but we can save at less billion by leave to private industry the build of plant to make liquid or gas fuel from coal we're ask that another major industry business subsidy i should say the export import bank loan authority be reduce by one 3 in we're do this because the primary beneficiary of taxpayer fund in this case be the export company themselves much of them profitable corporation this bring me to a numb of other lend program in which government make low interest loan some of them at a interest rate as low as percent what have not be very good understand be that the treasury department have no money of its own to lend it have to go into the private capital market and borrow the money so in this time of excessive interest rate the government find itself borrow at a interest rate several time as high as the interest it get back from that it lend the money to and this difference of course be pay by your constituent the taxpayer they get hit again if they try to borrow because government borrow contribute to raise all interest rate by terminate the economic development administration we can save hundred of million of dollar in and billion much over the next few year there's a lack of consistent and convince evidence that eda and its regional commission have be effective in create new job they have be effective in create a array of planner grantsmen and professional middleman we believe we can do good just by the expansion of the economy and the job creation which will come from our economic program the food stamp program will be restore to its original purpose to assist that without resource to purchase sufficient nutritional food we will however save billion in fiscal year by remove from eligibility that who be not in real need or who be abuse the program but even with this reduction the program will be budget for much than billion we will tighten welfare and give much attention to outside source of income when determine the amount of welfare that a individual be allow this plus strong and effective work requirement will save million in the next year i state a moment ago our intention to keep the school breakfast and lunch program for that in true need but by cut back on meal for child of family who can afford to pay the saving will be billion in the fiscal year now let me just touch on a few other area which be typical of the kind of reduction we've include in this economic package the trade adjustment assistance program provide benefit for worker who be unemployed when foreign import reduce the market for various american product cause shutdown of plant and layoff of worker the purpose be to help this worker find job in grow sector of our economy there's nothing wrong with that but because this benefit be pay out on top of normal unemployment benefit we wind up pay great benefit to that who lose their job because of foreign competition than we do to their friend and neighbor who be lay off due to domestic competition anyone must agree that this be unfair putting this two program on the same foot will save billion in just year early i make mention of change categorical grant to state and local government into block grant now we know of course that the categorical grant program burden local and state government with a mass of federal regulation and federal paperwork ineffective target wasteful administrative overhead all can be eliminate by shift the resource and decision make authority to local and state government this will also consolidate program which be scatter throughout the federal bureaucracy bring government close to the people and save billion over the next year our program for economic renewal deal with a numb of program which at present be not cost effective a example be medicaid right now washington provide the state with unlimited match payment for their expenditure at the same time we here in washington pretty much dictate how the state be go to manage that program we want to put a cap on how much the federal government will contribute but at the same time allow the state much much flexibility in manage and structure the program i know from our experience in california that such flexibility can have lead to far much cost effective reform now this will bring a saving of billion next year the space program have be and be important to america and we plan to continue it we believe however that a reorder of priority to focus on the much important and cost effective nasa program can result in a saving of a quarter of a million dollar now come down from space to the mailbox the postal service have be consistently unable to live within its operate budget it be still dependent on large federal subsidy we propose reduce that subsidy by million in to press the postal service into become much effective and in subsequent year the saving will continue to add up the economic regulatory administration in the department of energy have program to force company to convert to specific fuel it have the authority to administer a gas ration plan and prior to decontrol it run the oil price control program with this and other regulation go we can save several hundred of million of dollar over the next few year i'm sure there's one department you've be wait for me to mention the department of defense it's the only department in our entire program that will actually be increase over the present budget figure but even here there be no exemption the department of defense come up with a numb of cut which reduce the budget increase need to restore our military balance this measure will save billion in outlay and by a total of billion will have be save or perhaps i should say will have be make available for the necessary thing that we must do the aim will be to provide the much effective defense for the low possible cost i believe that my duty as president require that i recommend increase in defense spend over the come year i know that you're all aware but i think it bear say again that since the soviet union have invest billion much in its military force than we have as a result of its massive military buildup the soviet have make a significant numerical advantage in strategic nuclear delivery system tactical aircraft submarine artillery and anti aircraft defense to allow this imbalance to continue be a threat to our national security notwithstanding our economic strait make the financial change begin now be far little costly than wait and have to attempt a crash program several year from now we remain commit to the goal of arm limitation through negotiation i hope we can persuade our adversary to come to realistic balance and verifiable agreement but as we negotiate our security must be fully protect by a balance and realistic defense program now let me say a word here about the general problem of waste and fraud in the federal government one government estimate indicate that fraud alone may account for anywhere from to percent as much as billion of federal expenditure for social program if the tax dollar that be waste or mismanage be add to this fraud total the stagger dimension of this problem begin to emerge the office of management and budget be now putting together a interagency task force to attack waste and fraud we're also plan to appoint as inspector general highly train professional who will spare no effort to do this job no administration can promise to immediately stop a trend that have grow in recent year as quickly as government expenditure themselves but let me say this waste and fraud in the federal government be exactly what i've call it before a unrelenting national scandal a scandal we're bind and determine to do something about march in lockstep with the whole program of reduction in spend be the equally important program of reduce tax rate both be essential if we're to have economic recovery it's time to create new job to build and rebuild industry and to give the american people room to do what they do good and that can only be do with a tax program which provide incentive to increase productivity for both worker and industry our proposal be for a percent across the board cut every year for year in the tax rate for all individual income taxpayer make a total cut in the tax cut rate of percent this year reduction will also apply to the tax on unearned income lead toward a eventual elimination of the present differential between the tax on earn and unearned income now i would have hope that we can be retroactive with this but as it stand the effective start date for this percent personal income tax rate reduction will call for as of july 1st of this year again let me remind you that while this percent reduction will leave the taxpayer with billion much in their pocket over the next year it's actually only a reduction in the tax increase already build into the system unlike some past tax reform this be not merely a shift of wealth between different set of taxpayer this proposal for a equal reduction in everyone's tax rate will expand our national prosperity enlarge national income and increase opportunity for all american some will argue i know that reduce tax rate now will be inflationary a solid body of economic expert do not agree and tax cut adopt over the past three fourth of a century indicate this economic expert be right they will not be inflationary i've have advice that in our real production in good and service will grow by percent and be billion high than it be today the average worker's wage will rise in real purchase power percent and this be in after tax dollar and this of course be predicate on a complete program of tax cut and spend reduction be implement the other part of the tax package be aim directly at provide business and industry with the capital need to modernize and engage in much research and development this will involve a increase in depreciation allowance and this part of our tax proposal will be retroactive to january 1st the present depreciation system be obsolete needlessly complex and economically counterproductive very simply it base the depreciation of plant machinery and vehicle and tool on their original cost with no recognition of how inflation have increase their replacement cost we're propose a much short write off time than be presently allow a year write off for machinery year for vehicle and truck and a year write off for plant in fiscal year under this plan business would acquire nearly billion for investment by the figure would be nearly billion this change be essential to provide the new investment which be need to create million of new job between now and and to make america competitive once again in the world market this won't be make work job they be productive job job with a future i'm good aware that there be many other desirable and need tax change such as index the income tax bracket to protect taxpayer against inflation the unjust discrimination against marry couple if both be work and earn tuition tax credit the unfairness of the inheritance tax especially to the family own farm and the family own business and a numb of other but our program for economic recovery be so urgently need to begin to bring down inflation that i'm ask you to act on this plan first and with great urgency and then i pledge i will join with you in seek this additional tax change at the early date possible american society experience a virtual explosion in government regulation during the past decade between and expenditure for the major regulatory agency quadruple the numb of page publish annually in the federal register nearly triple and the numb of page in the code of federal regulation increase by nearly two third the result have be high price high unemployment and low productivity growth overregulation cause small and independent business man and woman as good as large business to defer or terminate plan for expansion and since they're responsible for much of the new job that new job just aren't create now we have no intention of dismantle the regulatory agency especially that necessary to protect environment and assure the public health and safety however we must come to grip with inefficient and burdensome regulation eliminate that we can and reform the other i have ask vice president bush to head a cabinet level task force on regulatory relief 2 i ask each member of my cabinet to postpone the effective date of the hundred of new regulation which have not yet be implement 3 in coordination with the task force many of the agency head have already take prompt action to review and rescind exist burdensome regulation and finally just yesterday i sign a executive order that for the first time provide for effective and coordinate management of the regulatory process much have be accomplish but it's only a begin we will eliminate that regulation that be unproductive and unnecessary by executive order where possible and cooperate fully with you on that that require legislation the final aspect of our plan require a national monetary policy which do not allow money growth to increase consistently fast than the growth of good and service in order to curb inflation we need to slow the growth in our money supply now we fully recognize the independence of the federal reserve system and will do nothing to interfere with or undermine that independence we will consult regularly with the federal reserve board on all aspect of our economic program and will vigorously pursue budget policy that'll make their job easy in reduce monetary growth a successful program to achieve stable and and moderate growth pattern in the money supply will keep both inflation and interest rate down and restore vigor to our financial institution and market this then be our proposal america's new begin a program for economic recovery i don't want it to be simply the plan of my administration i'm here tonight to ask you to join me in make it our plan together we can embark on this road thank you very much i should have arrange to quit right here good together we can embark on this road not to make thing easy but to make thing good our social political and cultural as good as our economic institution can no long absorb the repeat shock that have be deal them over the past decade can we do the job the answer be yes but we must begin now we're in control here there's nothing wrong with america that together we can't fix i'm sure there'll be some who raise the old familiar cry don't touch my program cut somewhere else i hope i've make it plain that our approach have be evenhanded that only the program for the truly deserve needy remain untouched the question be be we simply go to go down the same path we've go down before carve out one special program here another special program there i don't think that's what the american people expect of us much important i don't think that's what they want they're ready to return to the source of our strength the substance and prosperity of our nation be build by wage bring home from the factory and the mill the farm and the shop they be the service provide in corner of america the interest on the thrift of our people and the return for their risk take the production of america be the possession of that who build serve create and produce for too long now we've remove from our people the decision on how to dispose of what they create we've stray from first principle we must alter our course the tax power of government must be use to provide revenue for legitimate government purpose it must not be use to regulate the the economy or bring about social change we've try that and surely we must be able to see it doesn't work spend by government must be limit to that function which be the proper province of government we can no long afford thing simply because we think of them next year we can reduce the budget by billion without harm to government's legitimate purpose or to our responsibility to all who need our benevolence this plus the reduction in tax rate will help bring a end to inflation in the health and social service area alone the plan we're propose will substantially reduce the need for page of law page of regulation federal employee who presently administer separate grant in about separate location over million man and woman hour of work by state and local official be require to fill out government form i would direct a question to that who have indicate already a unwillingness to accept such a plan have they a alternative which offer a great chance of balance the budget reduce and eliminate inflation stimulate the creation of job and reduce the tax burden and if they haven't be they suggest we can continue on the present course without come to a day of reckon if we don't do this inflation and the grow tax burden will put a end to everything we believe in and our dream for the future we don't have a option of live with inflation and its attendant tragedy million of productive people will and able to work but unable to find a buyer for their work in the job market we have a alternative and that be the program for economic recovery true it'll take time for the favorable effect of our proposal to be feel so we must begin now the people be watch and wait they don't demand miracle they do expect us to act let us act together thank you and good night mr speaker mr president distinguish member of the congress honor guest and fellow citizen today mark my first state of the union address to you a constitutional duty as old as our republic itself president washington begin this tradition in after remind the nation that the destiny of self government and the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty be finally stake on the experiment entrust to the hand of the american people for our friend in the press who place a high premium on accuracy let me say i do not actually hear george washington say that but it be a matter of historic record but from this podium winston churchill ask the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression franklin delano roosevelt speak of a day of infamy and summon a nation to arm douglas macarthur make a unforgettable farewell to a country he love and serve so good dwight eisenhower remind us that peace be purchase only at the price of strength and john f kennedy speak of the burden and glory that be freedom when i visit this chamber last year as a newcomer to washington critical of past policy which i believe have fail i propose a new spirit of partnership between this congress and this administration and between washington and our state and local government in forge this new partnership for america we can achieve the old hope of our republic prosperity for our nation peace for the world and the blessing of individual liberty for our child and someday for all of humanity it's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have make in our relation with other nation on the foundation we've carefully lay for our economic recovery and finally on a bold and spirit initiative that i believe can change the face of american government and make it again the servant of the people seldom have the stake be high for america what we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworkers in detroit lumberjack in the northwest steelworker in steubenville who be in the unemployment line to black teenager in newark and chicago to hard press farmer and small businessman and to million of everyday american who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their child to understand the state of the union we must look not only at where we be and where we're go but where we've be the situation at this time last year be truly ominous the last decade have see a series of recession there be a recession in in and again in the spring of each time unemployment increase and inflation soon turn up again we coin the word stagflation to describe this government's response to this recession be to pump up the money supply and increase spend in the last month of as a example the money supply increase at the fast rate in postwar history percent inflation remain in double digit and government spend increase at a annual rate of percent interest rate reach a stagger percent there be million unemployed late in we sink into the present recession largely because continue high interest rate hurt the auto industry and construction and there be a drop in productivity and the already high unemployment increase this time however thing be different we have a economic program in place completely different from the artificial quick fix of the past it call for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spend and already that rate have be cut nearly in half but reduce spend the first and small phase of a year tax rate reduction design to stimulate the economy and create job already interest rate be down to percent but they must still go low inflation be down from percent to and for the month of december it be run at a annualized rate of percent if we have not act as we do thing would be far bad for all american than they be today inflation tax and interest rate would all be high a year ago american faith in their governmental process be steadily decline six out of american be say they be pessimistic about their future a new kind of defeatism be hear some say our domestic problem be uncontrollable that we have to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment there be also pessimistic prediction about the relationship between our administration and this congress it be say we can never work together good that prediction be wrong the record be clear and i believe that history will remember this as a era of american renewal remember this administration as a administration of change and remember this congress as a congress of destiny together we not only cut the increase in government spend nearly in half we bring about the large tax reduction and the much sweep change in our tax structure since the begin of this century and because we index future tax to the rate of inflation we take away government's build in profit on inflation and its hide incentive to grow large at the expense of american worker together after year of take power away from the hand of the people in their state and local community we have start return power and resource to them together we have cut the growth of new federal regulation nearly in half in there be few page in the federal register which list new regulation than there be in by deregulate oil we've come close to achieve energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heat fuel together we have create a effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government in just month it have save the taxpayer much than billion and it's only get start together we've begin to mobilize the private sector not to duplicate wasteful and discredit government program but to bring thousand of american into a volunteer effort to help solve many of america's social problem together we've begin to restore that margin of military safety that ensure peace our country's uniform be be wear once again with pride together we have make a new begin but we have only begin no one pretend that the way ahead will be easy in my inaugural address last year i warn that the ill we suffer have come upon us over several decade they will not go away in day week or month but they will go away because we as american have the capacity now as we've have it in the past to do whatever need to be do to preserve this last and great bastion of freedom the economy will face difficult moment in the month ahead but the program for economic recovery that be in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year and that be why i can report to you tonight that in the near future the state of the union and the economy will be good much good if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've chart and so the question if the fundamental be in place what now good two thing first we must understand what's happen at the moment to the economy our current problem be not the product of the recovery program that's only just now get underway as some would have you believe they be the inheritance of decade of tax and tax and spend and spend 2 because our economic problem be deeply root and will not respond to quick political fix we must stick to our carefully integrate plan for recovery that plan be base on four commonsense fundamental continue reduction of the growth in federal spend preserve the individual and business tax reduction that will stimulate save and investment remove unnecessary federal regulation to spark productivity and maintain a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy the latter a responsibility of the federal reserve system the only alternative be offer to this economic program be a return to the policy that give us a trillion dollar debt runaway inflation runaway interest rate and unemployment the doubter would have us turn back the clock with tax increase that would offset the personal tax rate reduction already pass by this congress raise present tax to cut future deficit they tell us good i don't believe we should buy that argument there be too many imponderable for anyone to predict deficit or surplus several year ahead with any degree of accuracy the budget in place when i take office have be project as balance it turn out to have one of the big deficit in history another example of the imponderable that can make deficit projection highly questionable a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some billion as it now stand our forecast which we're require by law to make will show major deficit start at little than a hundred billion dollar and decline but still too high much important we're make progress with the three key to reduce deficit economic growth low interest rate and spend control the policy we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily surely and in time completely high tax would not mean low deficit if they do how would we explain that tax revenue much than double just since yet in that same year period we run the large series of deficit in our history in tax revenue increase by billion and in we have one of our all time big deficit raise tax won't balance the budget it will encourage much government spend and little private investment raise tax will slow economic growth reduce production and destroy future job make it much difficult for that without job to find them and much likely that that who now have job can lose them so i will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the back of the american taxpayer i will seek no tax increase this year and i have no intention of retreat from our basic program of tax relief i promise to bring the american people to bring their tax rate down and to keep them down to provide them incentive to rebuild our economy to save to invest in america's future i will stand by my word tonight i'm urge the american people seize this new opportunity to produce to save to invest and together we'll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom hope and prosperity again now the budget deficit this year will exceed our early expectation the recession do that it lower revenue and increase cost to some extent we're also victim of our own success we've bring inflation down fast than we think we can and in do this we've deprive government of that hide revenue that occur when inflation push people into high income tax bracket and the continue high interest rate last year cost the government about billion much than anticipate we must cut out much nonessential government spend and rout out much waste and we will continue our effort to reduce the numb of employee in the federal work force by the budget plan i submit to you on february 8th will realize major saving by dismantle the department of energy and education and by eliminate ineffective subsidy for business we'll continue to redirect our resource to our two high budget priority a strong national defense to keep america free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social program for that who have contribute and that who be in need contrary to some of the wild charge you may have hear this administration have not and will not turn its back on america's elderly or america's poor under the new budget fund for social insurance program will be much than double the amount spend only year ago but it would be foolish to pretend that this or any program cannot be make much efficient and economical the entitlement program that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goal and many deserve recipient we will protect them but there's only one way to see to it that this program really help that whom they be design to help and that be to bring their spiral cost under control today we face the absurd situation of a federal budget with three quarter of its expenditure routinely refer to as uncontrollable and a large part of this go to entitlement program committee after committee of this congress have hear witness after witness describe many of this program as poorly administer and rife with waste and fraud virtually every american who shop in a local supermarket be aware of the daily abuse that take place in the food stamp program which have grow by percent in the last year another example be medicare and medicaid program with worthy goal but whose cost have increase from billion to almost billion much than time as much in just year waste and fraud be serious problem back in federal investigator testify before one of your committee that corruption have permeate virtually every area of the medicare and medicaid health care industry one official say many of the people who be cheat the system be very confident that nothing be go to happen to them good something be go to happen not only the taxpayer be defraud the people with real dependency on this program be deprive of what they need because available resource be go not to the needy but to the greedy the time have come to control the uncontrollable in august we make a start i sign a bill to reduce the growth of this program by billion over the next year while at the same time preserve essential service for the truly needy shortly you will receive from me a message on far reform we intend to install some new but other long recommend by your own congressional committee i ask you to help make this saving for the american taxpayer the saving we propose in entitlement program will total some billion over year and will without affect social t security go a long way toward bring federal spend under control but don't be fool by that who proclaim that spend cut will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless the federal government will still subsidize million meal every day that's one out of seven of all the meal serve in america head start senior nutrition program and child welfare program will not be cut from the level we propose last year much than one half billion dollar have be propose for minority business assistance and research at the national institute of health will be increase by over million while meet all this need we intend to plug unwarranted tax loophole and strengthen the law which require all large corporation to pay a minimum tax i be confident the economic program we've put into operation will protect the needy while it trigger a recovery that will benefit all american it will stimulate the economy result in increase saving and provide capital for expansion mortgage for homebuilding and job for the unemployed now that the essential of that program be in place our next major undertake must be a program just as bold just as innovative to make government again accountable to the people to make our system of federalism work again our citizen feel they've lose control of even the much basic decision make about the essential service of government such as school welfare road and even garbage collection and they're right a maze of interlock jurisdiction and level of government confront average citizen in try to solve even the simple of problem they don't know where to turn for answer who to hold accountable who to praise who to blame who to vote for or against the main reason for this be the overpower growth of federal grant in aid program during the past few decade in the federal government have categorical grant program cost billion when i take office there be approximately cost nearly a hundred billion dollar program for energy for pollution control for social service for education and here in the congress it take at less committee just to try to keep track of them you know and i know that neither the president nor the congress can properly oversee this jungle of grant in aid indeed the growth of this grant have lead to the distortion in the vital function of government as one democratic governor put it recently the national government should be worry about arm control not pothole the growth in this federal program have in the word of one intergovernmental commission make the federal government much pervasive much intrusive much unmanageable much ineffective and costly and above all much un accountable let's solve this problem with a single bold stroke the return of some billion in federal program to state and local government together with the mean to finance them and a transition period of nearly year to avoid unnecessary disruption i will shortly send this congress a message describe this program i want to emphasize however that its full detail will have be work out only after close consultation with congressional state and local official start in fiscal the federal government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly grow medicaid program to go along with its exist responsibility for medicare as part of a financially equal swap the state will simultaneously take full responsibility for aid to family with dependent child and food stamp this will make welfare little costly and much responsive to genuine need because it'll be design and administer close to the grass root and the people it serve in the federal government will apply the full proceed from certain excise tax to a grass root trust fund that will belong in fair share to the state the total amount flow into this fund will be billion a year over the next year the state can use this money in either of two way if they want to continue receive federal grant in such area as transportation education and social service they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grant or to the extent they choose to forgo the federal grant program they can use their trust fund money on their own for that or other purpose there will be a mandatory pass through of part of this fund to local government by the state will be in complete control of over federal grant program the trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise tax will be turn over to the state they can then preserve low or raise tax on their own and fund and manage this program as they see fit in a single stroke we will be accomplish a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiral cost at the federal level while we ensure this program will be much responsive to both the people they're mean to help and the people who pay for them hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local government we're propose legislation for a experimental effort to improve and develop our depress urban area in the s and s this legislation will permit state and locality to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zone a broad range of special economic incentive in the zone will help attract new business new job new opportunity to america's inner city and rural town some will say our mission be to save free enterprise good i say we must free enterprise so that together we can save america some will also say our state and local community be not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership good that may have be true year ago before reform like reapportionment and the vote right act the year extension of which i strongly support it's no long true today this administration have faith in state and local government and the constitutional balance envision by the found father we also believe in the integrity decency and sound good sense of grass root american our faith in the american people be reflect in another major endeavor our private sector initiative task force be seek out successful community model of school church business union foundation and civic program that help community need such group be almost invariably far much efficient than government in run social program we're not ask them to replace discard and often discredit government program dollar for dollar service for service we just want to help them perform the good work they choose and help other to profit by their example three hundred and eighty five thousand corporation and private organization be already work on social program range from drug rehabilitation to job train and thousand much american have write us ask how they can help the volunteer spirit be still alive and good in america our nation's long journey towards civil right for all our citizen once a source of discord now a source of pride must continue with no backslide or slow down we must and shall see that that basic law that guarantee equal right be preserve and when necessary strengthen our concern for equal right for woman be firm and unshakable we launch a new task force on legal equity for woman and a fifty state project that will examine state law for discriminatory language and for the first time in our history a woman sit on the high court in the land so too the problem of crime one as real and deadly serious as any in america today it demand that we seek transformation of our legal system which overly protect the right of criminal while it leave society and the innocent victim of crime without justice we look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase job while continue to improve the quality of our air we're encourage by the bipartisan initiative of the house and be hopeful of far progress as the senate continue its deliberation so far i've concentrate largely now on domestic matter to view the state of the union in perspective we must not ignore the rest of the world there isn't time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social or foreign policy i should say a subject i intend to address in detail in the near future a few word however be in order on the progress we've make over the past year reestablish respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenge and goal that we will approach in the year ahead at ottawa and cancun i meet with leader of the major industrial power and develop nation now some of that i meet with be a little surprise that i didn't apologize for america's wealth instead i speak of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system can help them realize their aspiration for economic development and political freedom i believe last friendship be make and the foundation be lay for future cooperation in the vital region of the caribbean basin we're develop a program of aid trade and investment incentive to promote self sustain growth and a good much secure life for our neighbor to the south toward that who would export terrorism and subversion in the caribbean and elsewhere especially cuba and libya we will act with firmness our foreign policy be a policy of strength fairness and balance by restore america's military credibility by pursue peace at the negotiate table wherever both side be will to sit down in good faith and by regain the respect of america's ally and adversary alike we have strengthen our country's position as a force for peace and progress in the world when action be call for we're take it our sanction against the military dictatorship that have attempt to crush human right in poland and against the soviet regime behind that military dictatorship clearly demonstrate to the world that america will not conduct business as usual with the force of oppression if the event in poland continue to deteriorate far measure will follow now let me also note that private american group have take the lead in make january 30th a day of solidarity with the people of poland so too the european parliament have call for march 21st to be a international day of support for afghanistan good i urge all peace love people to join together on that day to raise their voice to speak and pray for freedom meanwhile we're work for reduction of arm and military activity as i announce in my address to the nation last november 18th we have propose to the soviet union a far reach agendum for mutual reduction of military force and have already initiate negotiation with them in geneva on intermediate range nuclear force in that talk it be essential that we negotiate from a position of strength there must be a real incentive for the soviet to take this talk seriously this require that we rebuild our defense in the last decade while we seek the moderation of soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation the soviet engage in a unrelenting buildup of their military force the protection of our national security have require that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military force we have not neglect to strengthen our traditional alliance in europe and asia or to develop key relationship with our partner in the middle east and other country build a much peaceful world require a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up when radical force threaten our friend when economic misfortune create condition of instability when strategically vital part of the world fall under the shadow of soviet power our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence that's why we've lay such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program your recent passage of the foreign assistance act send a signal to the world that america will not shrink from make the investment necessary for both peace and security our foreign policy must be root in realism not naivete or self delusion a recognition of what the soviet empire be about be the start point winston churchill in negotiate with the soviet observe that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nation that's why we've move to reconstruct our national defense we intend to keep the peace we will also keep our freedom we have make pledge of a new frankness in our public statement and worldwide broadcast in the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation we've promise the world a season of truth the truth of our great civilize idea individual liberty representative government the rule of law under god we've never need wall or minefield or barbed wire to keep our people in nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from vote for the kind of government they want yes we have our problem yes we're in a time of recession and it's true there's no quick fix as i say to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment but we will end it the process have already begin and we'll see its effect as the year go on we speak with pride and admiration of that little band of american who overcome insuperable odd to set this nation on course year ago but our glory didn't end with them american ever since have emulate their deed we don't have to turn to our history book for hero they're all around us one who sit among you here tonight epitomize that heroism at the end of the long imprisonment ever inflict

open and jeremiah denton come slowly down the ramp he catch sight of our flag salute it say god bless america and then thank us for bring him home just week ago in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the potomac we see again the spirit of american heroism at its fine the heroism of dedicate rescue worker save crash victim from icy water and we see the heroism of one of our young government employee lenny skutnik who when he see a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line dive into the water and drag her to safety and then there be countless quiet everyday hero of american who sacrifice long and hard so their child will know a good life than they've know church and civic volunteer who help to fee clothe nurse and teach the needy million who've make our nation and our nation's destiny so very special unsung hero who may not have realize their own dream themselves but then who reinvest that dream in their child don't let anyone tell you that america's good day be behind her that the american spirit have be vanquish we've see it triumph too often in our life to stop believe in it now a hundred and twenty year ago the great of all our president deliver his 2 state of the union message in this chamber we cannot escape history abraham lincoln warn we of this congress and this administration will be remember in spite of ourselves the trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the late last generation good that president and that congress do not fail the american people together they weather the storm and preserve the union let it be say of us that we too do not fail that we too work together to bring america through difficult time let us so conduct ourselves that two century from now another congress and another president meet in this chamber as we be meet will speak of us with pride say that we meet the test and preserve for them in their day the sacred flame of liberty this last good hope of man on earth god bless you and thank you mr speaker mr president distinguish member of the congress honor guest and fellow citizen this solemn occasion mark the 196th time that a president of the unite state have report on the state of the union since george washington first do so in that's a lot of report but there's no shortage of new thing to say about the state of the union the very key to our success have be our ability foremost among nation to preserve our last value by make change work for us rather than against us i would like to talk with you this even about what we can do together not as republican and democrat but as american to make tomorrow's america happy and prosperous at home strong and respect abroad and at peace in the world as we gather here tonight the state of our union be strong but our economy be trouble for too many of our fellow citizen farmer steel and auto worker lumbermen black teenager work mother this be a painful period we must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to a end it have fall to us in our time to undo damage that be a long time in the make and to begin the hard but necessary task of build a good future for ourselves and our child we have a long way to go but thank to the courage patience and strength of our people america be on the mend but let me give you just one important reason why i believe this it involve many member of this body just day ago after month of debate and deadlock the bipartisan commission on social security accomplish the seemingly impossible social security as some of us have warn for so long face disaster i myself have be talk about this problem for almost year as begin the system stand on the brink of bankruptcy a double victim of our economic ill first a decade of rampant inflation drain its reserve as we try to protect beneficiary from the spiral cost of live then the recession and the sudden end of inflation wither the expand wage base and increase revenue the system need to support the million american who depend on it when the speaker of the house the senate majority leader and i perform the bipartisan or form the bipartisan commission on social security pundit and expert predict that party division and conflict interest would prevent the commission from agree on a plan to save social security good sometimes even here in washington the cynic be wrong through compromise and cooperation the member of the commission overcome their difference and achieve a fair workable plan they prove that when it come to the national welfare american can still pull together for the common good tonight i'm especially please to join with the speaker and the senate majority leader in urge the congress to enact this plan by easter there be element in it of course that none of us prefer but take together it perform a package that all of us can support it ask for some sacrifice by all the self employ beneficiary worker government employee and the good off among the retire but it impose a undue burden on none and in support it we keep a important pledge to the american people the integrity of the social security system will be preserve and no one's payment will be reduce the commission's plan will do the job indeed it must do the job we owe it to today's old american and today's young worker so before we go any far i ask you to join with me in salute the member of the commission who be here tonight and senate majority leader howard baker and speaker tip o'neill for a job good do i hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guide you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenge of the year ahead nearly half a century ago in this chamber another american president franklin delano roosevelt in his 2 state of the union message urge america to look to the future to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that look forward not backward throughout the world he say change be the order of the day in every nation economic problem long in the make have bring crisis to of many kind for which the master of old practice and theory be unprepared he also remind us that the future lie with that wise political leader who realize that the great public be interest much in government than in politic so let us in this next year man and woman of both party every political shade concentrate on the long range bipartisan responsibility of government not the short range or short term temptation of partisan politic the problem we inherit be far bad than much inside and out of government have expect the recession be deep than much inside and out of government have predict cure that problem have take much time and a high toll than any of us want unemployment be far too high project federal spend if government refuse to tighten its own belt will also be far too high and can weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway this recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spend for consumer item and capital good the stimulus we need to restart our stall economic engine the american people have already step up their rate of save assure that the fund need to modernize our factory and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry the inflationary expectation that lead to a percent interest prime rate and soar mortgage rate year ago be now reduce by almost half leader have start to realize that double digit inflation be no long a way of life i misspoke there i should have say lender so interest rate have tumble pave the way for recovery in vital industry like house and auto the early evidence of that recovery have start come in house start for the 4 quarter of be up percent from a year ago and house permit a sure indicator of future growth be up a whopping percent we're witness a upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that american industry will once again become competitive in market at home and abroad ensure much job and good income for the nation's work force but our confidence must also be temper by realism and patience quick fix and artificial stimulant repeatedly apply over decade be what bring us the inflationary disorder that we've now pay such a heavy price to cure the permanent recovery in employment production and investment we seek won't come in a sharp short spurt it'll build carefully and steadily in the month and year ahead in the meantime the challenge of government be to identify the thing that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the american people the federal budget be both a symptom and a cause of our economic problem unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spend we can face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future failure to cope with this problem now can mean as much as a trillion dollar much in national debt in the next year alone that would average in additional debt for every man woman child and baby in our nation to assure a sustain recovery we must continue get runaway spend under control to bring that deficit down if we don't the recovery will be too short unemployment will remain too high and we will leave a unconscionable burden of national debt for our child that we must not do let's be clear about where the deficit problem come from contrary to the drumbeat we've be hear for the last few month the deficit we face be not root in defense spend take as a percentage of the gross national product our defense spend happen to be only about four fifth of what it be in nor be the deficit as some would have it root in tax cut even with our tax cut tax as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they be in the fact be our deficit come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spend during the s the share of our national income devote to this domestic spend increase by much than percent from cent out of every dollar produce by the american people to cent in spite of all our economy and efficiency and without add any new program basic necessary domestic spend provide for in this year's budget will grow to almost a trillion dollar over the next year the deficit problem be a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic we need a plan to overcome this danger a plan base on this principle it must be bipartisan conquer the deficit and putting the government's house in order will require the good effort of all of us it must be fair just as all will share in the benefit that will come from recovery all would share fairly in the burden of transition it must be prudent the strength of our national defense must be restore so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintain our commitment to the truly needy and finally it must be realistic we can't rely on hope alone with this guide principle in mind let me outline a four part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficit first in my budget message i will recommend a federal spend freeze i know this be strong medicine but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spend the government have continue to spend much money each year though not as much much as it do in the past take as a whole the budget i'm propose for the fiscal year will increase no much than the rate of inflation in other word the federal government will hold the line on real spend now that's far little than many american family have have to do in this difficult time i will request that the propose month freeze in cost of live adjustment recommend by the bipartisan social security commission be apply to other government relate retirement program i will also propose a year freeze on a broad range of domestic spend program and for federal civilian and military pay and pension program and let me say right here i'm sorry with regard to the military in ask that of them because for so many year they have be so far behind and so low in reward for what the man and woman in uniform be do but i'm sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair 2 i will ask the congress to adopt specific measure to control the growth of the so call uncontrollable spend program this be the automatic spend program such as food stamp that cannot be simply freeze and that have grow by over percent since they be the large single cause of the build in or structural deficit problem our standard here will be fairness ensure that the taxpayer hard earn dollar go only to the truly needy that none of them be turn away but that fraud and waste be stamp out and i'm sorry to say there's a lot of it out there in the food stamp program alone last year we identify almost billion in overpayment the taxpayer aren't the only victim of this kind of abuse the truly needy suffer as fund intend for them be take not by the needy but by the greedy for everyone's sake we must put a end to such waste and corruption 3 i will adjust our program to restore america's defense by propose billion in defense saving over the next year this be saving recommend to me by the secretary of defense who have assure me they can be safely achieve and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arm reduction or endanger america's security we will not gamble with our national survival and 4 because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficit over the next several year i will propose a standby tax limit to no much than percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal it would last no much than year and it would start only if the congress have first approve our spend freeze and budget control program and there be several other condition also that must be meet all of them in order for this program to be trigger now you can say that this be a insurance policy for the future a remedy that will be at hand if need but only resort to if absolutely necessary in the meantime we'll continue to study way to simplify the tax code and make it much fair for all american this be a goal that every american who's ever struggle with a tax form can understand at the same time however i will oppose any effort to undo the basic tax reform that we've already enact include the percent tax break come to taxpayer this july and the tax index which will protect all american from inflationary bracket creep in the year ahead now i realize that this four part plan be easy to describe than it will be to enact but the loom deficit that hang over us and over america's future must be reduce the path i've outline be fair balance and realistic if enact it will ensure a steady decline in deficit aim toward a balance budget by the end of the decade it's the only path that will lead to a strong sustain recovery let us follow that path together no domestic challenge be much crucial than provide stable permanent job for all american who want to work the recovery program will provide job for much but other will need special help and train for new skill shortly i will submit to the congress the employment act of design to get at the special problem of the long term unemployed as good as young people try to enter the job market i'll propose extend unemployment benefit include special incentive to employer who hire the long term unemployed provide program for displace worker and help federally fund and state administer unemployment insurance program provide worker with train and relocation assistance finally our proposal will include new incentive for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market we must offer both short term

value be the bedrock of our strength they unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our ally and friend in nato in asia in latin america and elsewhere they be also the value which in the

of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom in london last year i announce the commitment of the unite state to develop the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world we intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously the future belong not to government and ideology which oppress their people but to democratic system of self government which encourage individual initiative and

international monetary fund to ensure it have adequate resource to help bring the world economy back to strong noninflationary growth as the leader of the west and as a country that have become great and rich because of economic freedom america must be a unrelenting advocate of free trade as some nation be tempt to turn to protectionism our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way

of our caribbean basin initiative which pass the house last year be one of this administration's top legislative priority for the security and economic assistance policy of this administration in latin america and elsewhere be base on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race this undertake be a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branch and i'm count on the cooperation and statesmanship of the congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal at the heart of our strategy for peace be our relationship with the soviet union the past year see a change in soviet leadership we're prepare for a positive change in soviet american relation but the soviet union must show by deed as good as word a sincere commitment to respect the right and sovereignty of the family of nation responsible member of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbor and they restrain their ally from aggression for our part we're vigorously pursue arm reduction negotiation with the soviet union support by our ally we've put forward draft agreement propose significant weapon reduction to equal and verifiable low level we insist on a equal balance of force and give the overwhelm evidence of soviet violation of international treaty concern chemical and biological weapon we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be

proposal at the same time let me emphasize that ally steadfastness remain a key to achieve arm reduction with firmness and dedication we'll continue to negotiate deep down the soviet must know it's in their interest as good as ours to prevent a wasteful arm race and once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence they will have every reason to join us in the search for great security and major arm reduction when that moment come and i'm confident that it will we will have take a important step toward a much peaceful future for all the world's people a very wise man bernard baruch once say that america have never forget the noble thing that bring her into be and that light her path our country be a special place because we american have always be sustain through good time and bad by a noble vision a vision not only of what the world around us be today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow we're realist we solve our problem instead of ignore them no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us but we're also idealist for it be a ideal that bring our ancestor to this shore from every corner of the world right now we need both realism and idealism million of our neighbor be without work it be up to us to see they aren't without hope this be a task for all of us and may i say american have rally to this cause prove once again that we be the much generous people on earth we who be in government must take the lead in restore the economy and here all that time i think you be read the paper the single thing the single thing that can start the wheel of industry turn again be far reduction of interest rate just another or point can mean ten of thousand of job right now with inflation as low as it be percent there be room for interest rate to come down only fear prevent their reduction a lender as we know must charge a interest rate that recover the depreciate value of the dollar loan and that depreciation be of course the amount of inflation today interest rate be base on fear fear that government will resort to measure as it have in the past that will send inflation zoom again we who serve here in this capital must erase that fear by make it absolutely clear that we will not stop fight inflation that together we will do only that thing that will lead to last economic growth yes the problem confront us be large and forbid and certainly no one can or should minimize the plight of million of our friend and neighbor who be live in the bleak emptiness of unemployment but we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful back over the year citizen like ourselves have gather within this wall when our nation be threaten sometimes when its very existence be at stake always with courage and common sense they meet the crisis of their time and live to see a strong good and much prosperous country the present situation be no bad and in fact be not as bad as some of that they face time and again they prove that there be nothing we american cannot achieve as free man and woman yes we still have problem plenty of them but it's just plain wrong unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let that problem stand in the way of the much important truth of all america be on the mend we owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can no one can quarrel with that we must and do have compassion for all the victim of this economic crisis but the big story about america today be the way that million of confident care people that extraordinary ordinary american who never make the headline and will never be interview be lay the foundation not just for recovery from our present problem but for a good tomorrow for all our people from coast to coast on the job and in classroom and laboratory at new construction site and in church and community group neighbor be help neighbor and they've already begin the build the research the work and the give that will make our country great again i believe this because i believe in them in the strength of their heart and mind in the commitment that each one of them bring to their daily life be they high or humble the challenge for us in government be to be worthy of them to make government a help not a hindrance to our people in the challenge but promise day ahead if we do that if we care what our child and our children's child will say of us if we want them one day to be thankful for what we do here in this temple of freedom we will work together to make america good for our have be here not just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond thank you and god bless you mr speaker mr president distinguish member of the congress honor guest and fellow citizen once again in keep

through the day to come you and i have have some honest and open difference in the year past but they didn't keep us from join hand in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that have drain this nation's spirit and erode its health there be renew energy and optimism throughout the land america be back stand tall look to the eighty with courage confidence and hope the problem we're overcome be not the heritage of one person party or even one generation it's just the tendency of government to grow for practice and program to become the near thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth and there's always that good intentioned chorus of voice say with a little much power and a little much money we can do so much for the people for a time we forget the american dream isn't one of make government big it's keep faith with the mighty spirit of free people under god as we come to the decade of the eighty we face the bad crisis in our postwar history in the seventy be year of rise problem and fall confidence there be a feel government have grow beyond the consent of the govern family feel helpless in the face of mount inflation and the indignity of tax that reduce reward for hard work thrift and risktaking all this be overlay by a evergrowing web of rule and regulation on the international scene we have a uncomfortable feel that we'd lose the respect of friend and foe some question whether we have the will to defend peace and freedom but america be too great for small dream there be a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival if you will a crusade for renewal the american people say let us look to the future with confidence both at home and abroad let us give freedom a chance american be ready to make a new begin and together we have do it we're confront our problem one by one hope be alive tonight for million of young family and senior citizen set free from unfair tax increase and crush inflation inflation have be beat down from to percent and that's a great victory for all the people the prime rate have be cut almost in half and we must work together to bring it down even much together we pass the first across the board tax reduction for everyone since the kennedy tax cut next year tax rate will be index so inflation can't push people into high bracket when they get cost of live pay raise government must never again use inflation to profit at the people's expense today a work family earn have much in purchase power than if tax and inflation rate be still at the level real after tax income increase percent last year and economic deregulation of key industry like transportation have offer much chance or choice i should say to consumer and new change or chance for entrepreneur and protect safety tonight we can report and be proud of one of the good recovery in decade send away the handwringers and the doubt thomases hope be reborn for couple dream of own home and for risktakers with vision to create tomorrow's opportunity the spirit of enterprise be spark by the sunrise industry of high tech and by small business people with big idea people like barbara proctor who rise from a ghetto to build a multimillion dollar advertise agency in chicago carlos perez a cuban refugee who turn and a dream into a successful import business in coral gable florida people like this be hero for the eighty they help million american find job in much people be draw paycheck tonight than ever before and congress help or progress help everyone good congress do too everyone in woman fill percent of all the new job in

tell them you be not forget we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your god give talent will take you the heart of america be strong it's good and true the cynic be wrong america never be a sick society we're see rededication to bedrock value of faith family work neighborhood peace and freedom value that help bring us together as one people from the young child to the much senior citizen the congress deserve america's thank for help us restore pride and credibility to our military and i hope that you're as proud as i be of the young man and woman in uniform who have

tide of the future be a freedom tide and our struggle for democracy cannot and will not be deny this nation champion peace that enshrine liberty democratic right and dignity for every individual america's new strength confidence and purpose be carry hope and opportunity far from our shore a world economic recovery be underway it begin here we've journey far but we have much far to go franklin roosevelt tell us year ago this month civilization can not go back civilization must not stand still we have undertake new method it be our task to perfect to improve to alter when necessary but in all case to go forward it's time to move forward again time for america to take freedom's next step let us unite tonight behind four great goal to keep america free secure and at peace in the eighty together we can ensure steady economic growth we can develop america's next frontier we can strengthen our traditional value and we can build a meaningful peace to protect our love one and this shine star of faith that have guide million from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom progress and hope do this thing will open wide the gate of opportunity provide great security for all with no barrier of bigotry or discrimination the key to a dynamic decade be vigorous economic growth our first great goal we may good begin with common sense in federal budget government spend no much than government take in we must bring federal deficit down but how we do that make all the difference we can begin by limit the size and scope of government under the leadership of vice president bush we have reduce the growth of federal regulation by much than percent and cut good over million hour of government require paperwork each year this will save the public much than billion over the next year the grace commission have give us some recommendation for reduce wasteful spend and they're be examine throughout the administration federal spend growth have be cut from percent in to little than half of that today and we have already achieve over billion in budget saving for the period of to but that's only a little much than half of what we seek government be still spend too large a percentage of the total economy now some insist that any far budget saving must be obtain by reduce the portion spend on defense this ignore the fact that national defense be solely the responsibility of the federal government indeed it be its prime responsibility and yet defense spend be little than a 3 of the total budget during the year of president kennedy and of the year before that defense be almost half the total budget and then come several year in which our military capability be allow to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree we be just now restore through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic force our capability to meet our present and future security need we dare not shirk our responsibility to keep america free secure and at peace the last decade see domestic spend surge literally out of control but the basis for such spend have be lay in previous year a pattern of overspend have be in place for half a century as the national debt grow we be tell not to worry that we owe it to ourselves now we know that deficit be a cause for worry but there's a difference of opinion as to whether tax should be increase spend cut or some of both fear be express that government borrow to fund the deficit can inhibit the economic recovery by take capital need for business and industrial expansion good i think that debate be miss a important point whether government borrow or increase tax it will be take the same amount of money from the private sector and either way that's too much simple fairness dictate that government must not raise tax on family struggle to pay their bill the root of the problem be that government's share be much than we can afford if we're to have a sound economy we must bring down the deficit to ensure continue economic growth in the budget that i will submit on february 1st i will recommend measure that will reduce the deficit over the next year many of this will be unfinished business from last year's budget some can be enact quickly if we can join in a serious effort to address this problem i speak today with speaker of the house o'neill senate majority leader baker senate minority leader byrd and house minority leader michel i ask them if they would designate congressional representative to meet with representative of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan i know it would take a long hard struggle to agree on a full scale plan so what i have propose be that we first see if we can agree on a down payment now i believe there be basis for such a agreement one that can reduce the deficit by about a hundred billion dollar over the next year we can focus on some of the little contentious spend cut that be still pend before the congress this can be combine with measure to close certain tax loophole measure that the treasury department have previously say to be worthy of support in addition we can examine the possibility of achieve far outlay saving base on the work of the grace commission if the congressional leadership be will my representative will be prepare to meet with theirs at the early possible time i would hope the leadership may agree on a expedite timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment but a down payment alone be not enough to break us out of the deficit problem it can help us start on the right path yet we must do much so i propose that we begin explore how together we can make structural reform to curb the build in growth of spend i also propose improvement in the budget process some of our state grant their governor the right to veto individual item in appropriation bill without have to veto the entire bill california be one of that state as governor i find this line item veto be a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spend it work in state let's put it to work in washington for all the people it would be much effective if do by constitutional amendment the majority of american approve of such a amendment just as they and i approve of a amendment mandate a balance federal budget many state also have this protection in their constitution to talk of meet the present situation by increase tax be a band aid solution which do nothing to cure a illness that's be come on for half a century to say nothing of the fact that it pose a real threat to economic recovery let's remember that a substantial amount of income tax be presently owe and not pay by people in the underground economy it would be immoral to make that who be pay tax pay much to compensate for that who aren't pay their share there's a good way let us go forward with a historic reform for fairness simplicity and incentive for growth i be ask secretary don regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code so all taxpayer big and small be treat much fairly and i believe such a plan can result in that underground economy be bring into the sunlight of honest tax compliance and it can make the tax base broad so personal tax rate can come down not go up i've ask that specific recommendation consistent with that objective be present to me by december our 2 great goal be to build on america's pioneer spirit i say something funny i say america's next frontier and that's to develop that frontier a sparkle economy spur initiative sunrise industry and make old one much competitive nowhere be this much important than our next frontier space nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life good on earth the space age be barely a quarter of a century old but already we've push civilization forward with our advance in science and technology opportunity and job will multiply as we cross new threshold of knowledge and reach deep into the unknown our progress in space take giant step for all mankind be a tribute to american teamwork and excellence our fine mind in government industry and academia have all pull together and we can be proud to say we be first we be the good and we be so because we're free america have always be great when we dare to be great we can reach for greatness again we can follow our dream to distant star live and work in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain tonight i be direct nasa to develop a permanently man space station and to do it within a decade a space station will permit quantum leap in our research in science communication in metal and in lifesaving medicine which can be manufacture only in space we want our friend to help us meet this challenge and share in their benefit nasa will invite other country to participate so we can strengthen peace build prosperity and expand freedom for all who share our goal just as the ocean open up a new world for clipper ship and yankee trader space hold enormous potential for commerce today the market for space transportation can surpass our capacity to develop it company interest in putting payload into space must have ready access to private sector launch service the department of transportation will help a expendable launch service industry to get off the grind we'll soon implement a numb of executive initiative develop proposal to ease regulatory constraint and with nasa's help promote private sector investment in space and as we develop the frontier of space let us remember our responsibility to preserve our old resource here on earth preservation of our environment be not a liberal or conservative challenge it's common sense though this be a time of budget constraint i have request for epa one of the large percentage budget increase of any agency we will begin the long necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resource the chesapeake bay to reduce the threat pose by abandon hazardous waste dump epa will spend million and i will request a supplemental increase of million and because the superfund law expire in i've ask bill ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there'll be additional time to complete this important task on the question of acid rain which concern people in many area of the unite state and canada i'm propose a research program that double our current fund and we'll take additional action to restore our lake and develop new technology to reduce pollution that cause acid rain we have greatly improve the condition of our natural resource we'll ask the congress for million begin in to acquire new park and conservation land the department of the interior will encourage careful selective exploration and production on our vital resource in a exclusive economic zone within the mile limit off our coast but with strict adherence to environmental law and with full state and public participation but our much precious resource our great hope for the future be the mind and heart of our people especially our child we can help them build tomorrow by strengthen our community of share value this must be our 3 great goal for us faith work family neighborhood freedom and peace be not just word they're expression of what america mean definition of what make us a good and love people family stand at the center of our society and every family have a personal stake in promote excellence in education excellence do not begin in washington a percent increase in federal spend on education between and be accompany by a steady decline in scholastic aptitude test score excellence must begin in our home and neighborhood school where it's the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child our child come first and that's why i establish a bipartisan national commission on excellence in education to help us chart a commonsense course for good education and already community be implement the commission's recommendation school be report progress in math and read skill but we must do much to restore discipline to school and we must encourage the teach of new basic reward teacher of merit enforce tough standard and put our parent back in charge i will continue to press for tuition tax credit to expand opportunity for family and to soften the double payment for that pay public school tax and private school tuition our proposal would target assistance to low and middle income family just as much incentive be need within our school great competition be need among our school without standard and competition there can be no champion no record break no excellence in education or any other walk of life and while i'm on this subject each day your member observe a year old tradition

again by child in every schoolroom across this land america be found by people who believe that god be their rock of safety he be ours i recognize we must be cautious in claim that god be on our side but i think it's all right to keep ask if we're on his side during our first year we have join bipartisan effort to restore protection of the law to unborn child now i know this issue be very controversial but unless and until it can be prove that a unborn child be not a live human be can we justify assume without proof that it isn't no one have yet offer such proof indeed all the evidence be to the contrary we should rise above bitterness and reproach and if american can come together in a spirit of understand and help then we can find positive solution to the tragedy of abortion economic recovery good education rededication to value all show the spirit of renewal gain the upper hand and all will improve family life in the eighty but family need much they need assurance that

get young and strong it doesn't need rest and supervision it need new challenge great freedom and that word freedom be the key to the 2 american revolution that we need to bring about let us move together with a historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth last year i ask treasury secretary then regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayer would be treat much fairly and personal tax rate can come far down we have cut tax rate by almost percent yet the tax system remain unfair and limit our potential for growth exclusion and exemption cause similar income to be tax at different level low income family face steep tax barrier that make hard life even hard the treasury department have produce a excellent reform plan whose principle will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact one thing that tax reform will not be be a tax increase in disguise we will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that family need we will reduce personal tax rate as low as possible by remove many tax preference we will propose a top rate of no much than percent and possibly low and we will propose reduce corporate rate while maintain incentive for capital formation to encourage opportunity and job rather than dependency and welfare we will propose that individual live at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from federal income tax to restore fairness to family we will propose increase significantly the personal exemption and tonight i be instruct treasury secretary james baker i have to get use to say that to begin work with congressional author and committee for bipartisan legislation conform to this principle we will call upon the american people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber together we can pass this year a tax bill for fairness simplicity and growth make this economy the engine of our dream and america the investment capital of the world so let us begin tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleash the tremendous pen up power of our economy but a 2 american revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all it be time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the much distress area of our country this government will meet its responsibility to help that in need but policy that increase dependency break up family and destroy self respect be not progressive they're reactionary despite our stride in civil right black hispanics and all minority will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power we have

and have confidence in their future we'll continue to support the job train partnership act which have a nearly two third job placement rate credit in education and health care voucher will help work family shop for service that they need our administration be already encourage certain low income public house resident to own and manage their own dwelling it's time that all public house resident have that opportunity of ownership the federal government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom but state and locality many of which enjoy surplus from the recovery must not permit their tax and regulatory policy to stand as barrier to growth let us resolve that we will stop spread dependency and start spread opportunity that we will stop spread bondage and start spread freedom there be some who say that growth initiative must await final action on deficit reduction good the good way to reduce deficit be through economic growth much business will be start much investment make much job create and much people will be on payroll pay tax the good way to reduce government spend be to reduce the need for spend by increase prosperity each add percentage point per year of real gnp growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficit of nearly billion over year to move steadily toward a balance budget we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy we will not do this by raise tax we must make sure that our economy grow fast than the growth in spend by the federal government in our fiscal year budget overall government program spend will be freeze at the current level it must not be one dime high than fiscal year and three point be key first the social safety net for the elderly the needy the disable and unemployed will be leave intact growth of our major health care program medicare and medicaid will be slow but protection for the elderly and needy will be preserve 2 we must not relax our effort to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equip train and ready professional corp national security be government's first responsibility so in past year defense spend take about half the federal budget today it take little than a 3 we've already reduce our plan defense expenditure by nearly a hundred billion dollar over the past year and reduce project spend again this year you know we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger and then it become the arsenal of democracy spend for defense be invest in thing that be priceless peace and freedom 3 we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidy for example deregulation of the airline industry have lead to cheap airfares but on amtrak taxpayer pay about per passenger every time a amtrak train leave the station it's time we end this huge federal subsidy our farm program cost have quadruple in recent year yet i know from visit farmer many in great financial distress that we need a orderly transition to a market orient farm economy we can help farmer good not by expand federal payment but by make fundamental reform keep interest rate head down and knock down foreign trade barrier to american farm export we're move ahead with grace commission reform to eliminate waste and improve government's management practice in the long run we must protect the taxpayer from government and i ask again that you pass as state have now call for a amendment mandate the federal government spend no much than it take in and i ask for the authority use responsibly by governor to veto individual item in appropriation bill senator mattingly have introduce a bill permit a year trial run of the line item veto i hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk nearly year of government live beyond its mean have bring us to a time of reckon ours be but a moment in history but one moment of courage idealism and bipartisan unity can change american history forever sound monetary policy be key to long run economic strength and stability we will continue to cooperate with the federal reserve board seek a steady policy that ensure price stability without keep interest rate artificially high or needlessly hold down growth reduce unneeded red tape and regulation and deregulate the energy transportation and financial industry have unleash new competition give consumer much choice good service and low price in just one set of grant program we have reduce page of regulation to we seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supply and bring us close to energy independence consistent with safety standard we will continue remove restraint on the bus and railroad industry we will soon end up legislation or send up legislation i should say to return conrail to the private sector where it belong and we will support far deregulation of the truck industry every dollar the federal government do not take from us every decision it do not make for us will make our economy strong our life much abundant our future much free our 2 american revolution will push on to new possibility not only on earth but in the next frontier of space despite budget restraint we will seek record fund for research and development we've see the success of the space shuttle now we're go to develop a permanently man space station and new opportunity for free enterprise because in the next decade american and our friend around the world

produce super computer create job technology and medical breakthrough beyond anything we ever dream possible as we do all this we'll continue to protect our natural resource we will seek reauthorization and expand fund for the superfund program to continue clean up hazardous waste site which threaten human health and the environment now there's another great heritage to speak of this even of all the change that have sweep america the past year none bring great promise than our rediscovery of the value of faith freedom family work and neighborhood we see sign of renewal in increase attendance in place of worship renew optimism and faith in our future love of country rediscover by our young who be lead the way we've rediscover that work be good in and of itself that it ennoble us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our job we've see a powerful new current from a old and honorable tradition american generosity from thousand answer peace corp appeal to help boost food production in africa to million volunteer time corporation adopt school and community pull together to help the needy among us at home we have refound our value private sector initiative be crucial to our future i thank the congress for pass equal access legislation give religious group the same right to use classroom after school that other group enjoy but no citizen need tremble nor the world shudder if a child stand in a classroom and breathe a prayer we ask you again give child back a right they have for a century and a half or much in this country the question of abortion grip our nation abortion be either the take of a human life or it isn't and if it be and medical technology be increasingly show it be it must be stop it be a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many other who cannot become parent cry out for child to adopt we have room for this child we can fill the cradle of that who want a child to love and tonight i ask you in the congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn in the area of education we're return to excellence and again the hero be our people not government we're stress basic of discipline rigorous test and homework while help child become computer smart as good for year scholastic aptitude test score of our high school student go down but now they have go up of the last year we must go forward in our commitment to the new basic give parent great authority and make sure good teacher be reward for hard work and achievement through merit pay of all the change in the past year none have much threaten our sense of national good be than the explosion of violent crime one do not have to be attack to be a victim the woman who must run to her car after shop at night be a victim the couple drape their door with lock and chain be victim as be the tire decent clean woman who can't ride a subway home without be afraid we do not seek to violate the right of defendant but shouldn't we feel much compassion for the victim of crime than for that who commit crime for the first time in year the crime index have fall year in a row we've convict over drug offender and put them as good as leader of organize crime behind bar in record number but we must do much i urge the house to follow the senate and enact proposal permit use of all reliable evidence that police officer acquire in good faith this proposal would also reform the habeas corpus law and allow in keep with the will of the overwhelm majority of american the use of the death penalty where necessary there can be no economic revival in ghetto when the much violent among us be allow to roam free it's time we restore domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that just as we're position as never before to secure justice in our economy we're poise as never before to create a safe free much peaceful world our alliance be strong than ever our economy be strong than ever we have resume our historic role as a leader of the free world and all of this together be a great force for peace since we've be commit to seek fair and verifiable arm agreement that would low the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenal now our determination to maintain a strong defense have influence the soviet union to return to the bargain table our negotiator must be able to go to that table with the unite support of the american people all of us have no great dream than to see the day when nuclear weapon be ban from this earth forever each member of the congress have a role to play in modernize our defense thus support our chance for a meaningful arm agreement your vote this spring on the peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arm reduction for the past year we've believe that no war will be launch as long as each side know it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike good i believe there's a good way of eliminate the threat of nuclear war it be a strategic defense initiative aim ultimately at find a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missile it's the much hopeful possibility of the nuclear age but it's not very good understand some say it will bring war to the heaven but its purpose be to deter war in the heaven and on earth now some say the research would be expensive perhaps but it can save million of life indeed humanity itself and some say if we build such a system the soviet will build a defense system of their own good they already have strategic defense that surpass ours a civil defense system where we have almost none and a research program cover roughly the same area of technology that we're now explore and finally some say the research will take a long time good the answer to that be let's get start harry truman once say that ultimately our security and the world's hope for peace and human progress lie not in measure of defense or in the control of weapon but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self government and tonight we declare anew to our fellow citizen of the world freedom be not the sole prerogative of a choose few it be the universal right of all god's child look to where peace and prosperity flourish today it be in home that freedom build victory against poverty be great and peace much secure where people live by law that ensure free press free speech and freedom to worship vote and create wealth our mission be to nourish and defend freedom and democracy and to communicate this ideal everywhere we can america's economic success be freedom's success it can be repeat a hundred time in a hundred different nation many country in east asia and the pacific have few resource other than the enterprise of their own people but through low tax rate and free market they've soar ahead of centralize economy and now china be open up its economy to meet its need we need a strong and simple approach to the process of make and implement trade policy and we'll be study potential change in that process in the next few week we've see the benefit of free trade and live through the disaster of protectionism tonight i ask all our trade partner develop and develop alike to join us in a new round of trade negotiation to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy and to begin it in this next year there be much than billion human being live in 3 world country with a average per caput income of a year many be victim of dictatorship that impoverish them with taxation and corruption let us ask our ally to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that foster economic development through personal incentive to help this people climb from poverty on their own we cannot play innocent abroad in a world that's not innocent nor can we be passive when freedom be under siege without resource diplomacy cannot succeed our security assistance program help friendly government defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace and i hope that you in the congress will understand that dollar for dollar security assistance contribute as much to global security as our own defense budget we must stand by all our democratic ally and we must not break faith with that who be risk their life on every continent from afghanistan to nicaragua to defy soviet support aggression and secure right which have be ours from birth the sandinista dictatorship of nicaragua with full cuban soviet bloc support not only persecute its people the church and deny a free press but arm and provide base for communist terrorist attack neighbor state support for freedom fighter be self defense and totally consistent with the oas and u.n charter it be essential that the congress continue all facet of our assistance to central america i want to work with you to support the democratic force whose struggle be tie to our own security and tonight i've speak of great plan and great dream they're dream we

lumber giant slam shut the gate of opportunity threaten to crush the very root of our freedom what bring america back the american people bring us back with quiet courage and common sense with undying faith that in this nation under god the future will be ours for the future belong to the free tonight the american people deserve our thank for straight month of economic growth for sunrise firm and

last year alone and despite the pressure of our modern world family and community remain the moral core of our society guardian of our value and hope for the future family and community be the costars of this great american comeback they be why we say tonight private value must be at the heart of public policy what be true for family in america be true for america in the family of free nation history be no captive of some inevitable force history be make by man and woman of vision and courage tonight freedom be on the march the unite state be the economic miracle the model to which the world once again turn we stand for a idea whose time be now only by lift the weight from the shoulder of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nation be secure teddy roosevelt say that a nation that do great work life forever we have do good but we cannot stop at the foothill when everest beckon it's time for america to be all that we can be we speak tonight of a agendum for the future a agendum for a safe much secure world and we speak about the necessity for action to steel us for the challenge of growth trade and security in the next decade and the year and we will do it not by break faith with bedrock principle but by break free from fail policy let us begin where storm cloud loom dark right here in washington dc this week i will send you our detail proposal tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role not to control not to demand or command not to contain us but to help in time of need and above all to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all american can climb toward economic power and justice on their own but we cannot win the race to the future shackle to a system that can't even pass a federal budget we cannot win that race hold back by horse and buggy program that waste tax dollar and squander human potential we cannot win that race if we're swamp in a sea of red ink now mr speaker you know i know and the american people know the federal budget system be break it doesn't work before we leave this city let's you and i work together to fix it and then we can finally give the american people a balance budget member of congress passage of gramm rudman hollings give us a historic opportunity to achieve what have elude our national leadership for decade force the federal government to live within its mean your schedule now require that the budget resolution be pass by april 15th the very day america's family have to foot the bill for the budget that you produce how often we read of a husband and wife both work struggle from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family meet a mortgage pay their tax and bill and yet some in congress say tax must be raise good i'm sorry they're ask the wrong people to tighten their belt it's time we reduce the federal budget and leave the family budget alone we do not face large deficit because american family be undertaxed we face that deficit because the federal government overspend the detail budget that we will submit will meet the gramm rudman hollings target for deficit reduction meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly little fortunate and yes meet our commitment to not raise tax how should we accomplish this good not by take from that in need as family take care of their own government must provide shelter and nourishment for that who cannot provide for themselves but we must revise or replace program enact in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work encourage family breakup and drive entire community into a bleak and heartless dependency gramm rudman hollings can mark a dramatic improvement but experience show that simply set deficit target do not assure they'll be meet we must proceed with grace commission reform against waste and tonight i ask you to give me what governor have give me a line item veto this year give me the authority to veto waste and i'll take the responsibility i'll make the cut i'll take the heat this authority would not give me any monopoly power but simply prevent spend measure from sneak through that can not pass on their own merit and you can sustain or override my veto that's the way the system should work once we've make the hard choice we should lock in our gain with a balance budget amendment to the constitution i mention that we will meet our commitment to national defense we must meet it defense be not just another budget expense keep america strong free and at peace be solely the responsibility of the federal government it be government's prime responsibility we have devote year try to narrow a dangerous gap bear of illusion and neglect and we've make important gain yet the threat from soviet force conventional and strategic from the soviet drive for domination from the increase in espionage and state terror remain great this be reality close our eye will not make reality disappear we pledge together to hold real growth in defense spend to the bare minimum my budget honor that pledge and i'm now ask you the congress to keep its end of the bargain the soviet must know that if america reduce her defense it will be because of a reduce threat not a reduce resolve keep america strong be as vital to the national security as control federal spend be to our economic security but as i have say before the much powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit be a ever expand american economy unfettered and free the magic of opportunity unreserved unfailing unrestrained isn't this the call that unite us i believe our tax rate cut for the people have do much to spur a spirit of risk take and help america's economy break free than any program since john kennedy's tax cut almost a quarter century ago now history call us to press on to complete effort for a historic tax reform provide new opportunity for all and ensure that all pay their fair share but no much we've come this far will you join me now and we'll walk this last mile together you know my view on this we cannot and we will not accept tax reform that be a tax increase in disguise true reform must be a engine of productivity and growth and that mean a top personal rate no high than percent true reform must be truly fair and that mean raise personal exemption to true reform mean a tax system that at long last be profamily projobs profuture and pro america as we knock down the barrier to growth we must redouble our effort for free and fair trade we have already take action to counter unfair trade practice and to pry open close foreign market we will continue to do so we will also oppose legislation tout as provide protection that in reality pit one american worker against another one industry against another one community against another and that raise price for us all if the unite state can trade with other nation on a level play field we can outproduce outcompete and outsell anybody anywhere in the world the constant expansion of our economy and export require a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rate around the world we must never again permit wild currency swing to cripple our farmer and other exporter farmer in particular have suffer from past unwise government policy they must not be abandon with problem they do not create and cannot control we've begin coordinate economic and monetary policy among our major trade partner but there's much to do and tonight i be direct treasury secretary jim baker to determine if the nation of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currency confident in our future and secure in our value american be strive forward to embrace the future we see it

percent today and that rate have trigger the much house start in year the unemployment rate still too high be the low in nearly year and our people have create nearly million new job over percent of everyone over the age of male and female be employ the high percentage on record let's roll up our sleeve and go to work and put america's economic engine at full throttle we can also be hearten by our progress across the world much important america be at peace tonight and freedom be on the march and we've do much this past year to restore our defense our alliance and our leadership in the world our son and daughter in the service once again wear their uniform with pride but though we've make much progress i have one major regret i take a risk with regard to our action in iran it do not work and for that i assume full responsibility the goal be worthy i do not believe it be wrong to try to establish contact with a country of strategic importance or to try to save life and certainly it be not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizen hold in barbaric captivity but we do not achieve what we wish and serious mistake be make in try to do so we will get to the bottom of this and i will take whatever action be call for but in debate the past we must not deny ourselves the success of the future let it never be say of this generation of american that we become so obsess with failure that we refuse to take risk that can far the cause of peace and freedom in the world much be at stake here and the nation and the world be watch to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us and let there be no mistake about american policy we will not sit idly by if our interest or our friend in the middle east be threaten nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail and now lady and gentleman of the congress why don't we get to work i be please to report that because of our effort to rebuild the strength of america the world be a safe place early this month i submit a budget to defend america and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade good i ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affair budget that say yes to protect our country while the world be safe it be not safe since the soviet have invest billion much on their military force than we have even today though nearly in soviet family be without run hot water and the average family spend hour a day shop for the basic necessity of life their government still find the resource to transfer billion in weapon to client state in the past year client like syria vietnam cuba libya angola ethiopia afghanistan and nicaragua with soviet combat and military personnel and military adviser in asia africa and latin america can anyone still doubt their single mind determination to expand their power despite this the congress cut my request for critical u.s security assistance to free nation by percent this year and cut defense request by billion in the last year this assistance program serve our national interest as good as mutual interest and when the program be devastate american interest be harm my friend it's my duty as president to say to you again tonight that there be no sure way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve today the brave people of afghanistan be show that resolve the soviet union say it want a peaceful settlement in afghanistan yet it continue a brutal war and prop up a regime whose day be clearly number we be ready to support a political solution that guarantee the rapid withdrawal of all soviet troop and genuine self determination for the afghan people in central america too the cause of freedom be be test and our resolve be be test there as good here especially the world be watch to see how this nation respond today over percent of the people of latin america live in democracy democracy be on the march in central and south america communist nicaragua be the odd man out suppress the church the press and democratic dissent and promote subversion in the region we support diplomatic effort but this effort can never succeed if the sandinistas win their war against the nicaraguan people our commitment to a western hemisphere safe from aggression do not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we take office it begin with the monroe doctrine in and continue our historic bipartisan american policy franklin roosevelt say we be determine to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere president truman be very blunt international communism seek to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the americas we cannot let that happen here and john f kennedy make clear that communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiate some in this congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment but i will not this year we celebrate the 2 century of our constitution the sandinistas just sign theirs week ago and then suspend it we won't know how my word tonight will be report there for one simple reason there be no free press in nicaragua nicaraguan freedom fighter have never ask us to wage their battle but i will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death defeat or a life without freedom there must be no soviet beachhead in central america you know we american have always prefer dialog to conflict and so we always remain open to much constructive relation with the soviet union but much responsible soviet conduct around the world be a key element of the u.s soviet agendum progress be also require on the other item of our agendum as good real respect for human right and much open contact between our society and of course arm reduction in iceland last october we have one moment of opportunity that the soviet dash because they seek to cripple our strategic defense initiative sdi i wouldn't let them do it then i won't let them do it now or in the future this be the much positive and promise defense program we have undertake it's the path for both side to a safe future a system that defend human life instead of threaten it sdi will go forward the unite state have make serious fair and far reach proposal to the soviet union and this be a moment of rare opportunity for arm reduction but i will need and american negotiator in geneva will need congress support enact the soviet negotiate position into american law would not be the way to win a good agreement so i must tell you in this congress i will veto any effort that undercut our national security and our negotiate leverage now today we also find ourselves engage in expand peaceful commerce across the world we will work to expand our opportunity in international market through the uruguay round of trade negotiation and to complete a historic free trade arrangement between the world's two large trade partner canada and the unite state our basic trade policy remain the same we remain oppose as ever to protectionism because america's growth and future depend on trade but we would insist on trade that be fair and free we be always will to be trade partner but never trade patsy now from foreign border let us return to our own because america in the world be only as strong as america at home this 100th congress have high responsibility i begin with a gentle reminder that many of this be simply the incomplete obligation of the past the american people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order we've have great success in restore our economic integrity and we've rescue our nation from the bad economic mess since the depression but there's much to do for starter the federal deficit be outrageous for year i've ask that we stop push onto our child the excess of our government and what the congress finally need to do be pass a constitutional amendment that mandate a balance budget and force government to live within its mean state city and the family of america balance their budget why can't we next the budget process be a sorry spectacle the miss of deadline and the nightmare of monstrous continue resolution pack hundred of billion of dollar of spend into one bill must be stop we ask the congress once again give us the same tool that governor have a lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork that item that would never survive on their own i will send the congress broad recommendation on the budget but first i'd like to see yours let's go to work and get this do together but now let's talk about this year's budget even though i have submit it within the gramm rudman hollings deficit reduction target i have see suggestion that we may postpone that timetable good i think the american people be tire of hear the same old excuse together we make a commitment to balance the budget now let's keep it as for that suggestion that the answer be high tax the american people have repeatedly reject that shop wear advice they know that we don't have deficit because people be tax too little we have deficit because big government spend too much now next month i'll place two additional reform before the congress we've create a welfare monster that be a shock indictment of our sense of priority our national welfare system consist of some major program and over page of federal law and regulation on which much than billion be spend in i will propose a new national welfare strategy a program of welfare reform through state sponsor community base demonstration project this be the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap now we will never abandon that who through no fault of their own must have our help but let us work to see how many can be free from the dependency of welfare and make self support which the great majority of welfare recipient want much than anything else next let us remove a financial specter face our old american the fear of a illness so expensive that it can result in have to make a intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death i will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness now let's turn to the future it's widely say that america be lose her competitive edge good that won't happen if we act now how good prepare be we to enter the 21st century in my lifetime america set the standard for the world it be now time to determine that we should enter the next century have achieve a level of excellence unsurpassed in history we will achieve this first by guarantee that government do everything possible to promote america's ability to compete 2 we must act as individual in a quest for excellence that will not be measure by new proposal or billion in new fund rather it involve a expenditure of american spirit and just plain american grit the congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposal to enhance our competitiveness include new science and technology center and strong new fund for basic research the bill will include legal and regulatory reform and weapon to fight unfair trade practice competitiveness also mean give our farmer a shoot at participate fairly and fully in a change world market prepare for the future must begin as always with our child we need to set for them new and much rigorous goal we must demand much of ourselves and our child by raise literacy level dramatically by the year our child should master the basic concept of math and science and let's insist that student not leave high school until they have study and understand the basic document of our national heritage there's one much thing we can't let up on let's redouble our personal effort to provide for every child a safe and drug free learn environment if our crusade against drug succeed with our child we will defeat that scourge all over the country finally let's stop suppress the spiritual core of our national be our nation can not have be conceive without divine help why be it that we can build a nation with our prayer but we can't use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer the 100th congress of the unite state should be remember as the one that end the expulsion of god from america's classroom the quest for excellence into the 21st century begin in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace much than million new job will be create before the new century unfold and by then our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who want to work we must also enable our worker to adapt to the rapidly change nature of the workplace and i will propose substantial new federal commitment key to retrain and job mobility over the next few week i'll be send the congress a complete series of this special message on budget reform welfare reform competitiveness include education trade worker train and assistance agriculture and other subject the congress can give us this tool but to make this tool work it really come down to just be our good and that be the core of american greatness the responsibility of freedom press us towards high knowledge and i believe moral and spiritual greatness through low tax and small government government have its way of free people's spirit but only we each of us can let the spirit soar against our own individual standard excellence be what make freedom ring and isn't that what we do good we're enter our 3 century now but it's wrong to judge our nation by its year the calendar can't measure america because we be mean to be a endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reach no boundary to what we can do no end point to our hope the unite state constitution be the impassioned and inspire vehicle by which we travel through history it grow out of the much fundamental inspiration of our existence that we be here to serve him by live free that live free release in us the noble of impulse and the good of our ability that we would use this gift for good and generous purpose and would secure them not just for ourselves and for our child but for all mankind over the year i won't count if you don't nothing have be so heartwarming to me as speak to america's young and the little one especially so fresh face and so eager to know good from time to time i've be with them they will ask about our constitution and i hope you member of congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you'll permit me to share this thought again with the young people who may be listen or watch this even i've read the constitution of a numb of country include the soviet union's now some people be surprise to hear that they have a constitution and it even supposedly grant a numb of freedom to its people many country have write into their constitution provision for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly good if this be true why be the constitution of the unite state so exceptional good the difference be so small that it almost escape you but it's so great it tell you the whole story in just three word we the people in that other constitution the government tell the people of that country what they're allow to do in our constitution we the people tell the government what it can do and it can do only that thing list in that document and no other virtually every other revolution in history have just exchange one set of ruler for another set of ruler our revolution be the first to say the people be the master and government be their servant and you young people out there don't ever forget that someday you can be in this room but wherever you be america be depend on you to reach your high and be your good because here in america we the people be in charge just three word we the people that be the kid on christmas day look out from a freeze sentry post on the 38th parallel in korea or aboard a aircraft carrier in the mediterranean a million mile from home but do their duty we the people that be the warmhearted whose number we can't begin to count who'll begin the day with a little prayer for hostage they will never know and mia family they will never meet why because that's the way we be this unique breed we call american we the people they're farmer on tough time but who never stop feed a hungry world they're the volunteer at the hospital choke back their tear for the 100 time care for a baby struggle for life because of a mother who use drug and you'll forgive me a special memory it's a million mother like nelle reagan who never know a strange or turn a hungry person away from her kitchen door we the people they refute last week's television commentary downgrade our optimism and our idealism they be the entrepreneur the builder the pioneer and a lot of regular folk the true hero of our land who make up the much uncommon nation of doer in history you know they're american because their spirit be as big as the universe and their heart be big than their spirit we the people start the 3 century of a dream and stand up to some cynic who's try to tell us we're not go to get any good be we at the end good i can't tell it any good than the real thing a story record by james madison from the final moment of the constitutional convention september 17th as the last few member sign the document benjamin franklin the old delegate at year and in frail health look over toward the chair where george washington daily preside at the back of the chair be paint the picture of a sun on the horizon and turn to that sit next to him franklin observe that artist find it difficult in their paint to distinguish between a rise and a set sun good i know if we be there we can see that delegate sit around franklin lean in to listen much closely to him and then dr franklin begin to share his deep hope and fear about the outcome of their effort and this be what he say i have often look at that picture behind the president without be able to tell whether it be a rise or set sun but now at length i have the happiness to know that it be a rise and not a set sun good you can bet it's rise because my fellow citizen america isn't finish her good day have just begin thank you god bless you and god bless america mr speaker mr president and distinguish member of the house and senate when we first meet here year ago many of us for the first time it be with the hope of begin something new for america we meet here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work if anyone expect just a proud recitation of the accomplishment of my administration i say let's leave that to history we're not finish yet so my message to you tonight be put on your work shoe we're still on the job history record the power of the idea that bring us here that year ago idea like the individual's right to reach as far and as high as his or her talent will permit the free market as a engine of economic progress and as a ancient chinese philosopher lao tzu say govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish do not overdo it good this idea be part of a large notion a vision if you will of america herself a america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but a america too of strong family and vibrant neighborhood a america whose divergent but harmonize community be a reflection of a deep community of value the value of work of family of religion and of the love of freedom that god place in each of us and whose defense he have entrust in a special way to this nation all of this be make possible by a idea i speak of when mr gorbachev be here the belief that the much excite revolution ever know to humankind begin with three simple word we the people the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its right and not the other way around and there's one lesson that have come home powerfully to me which i would offer to you now just as that who create this republic pledge to each other their life their fortune and their sacred honor so too america's leader today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our heart and mind not what be good for ourselves or for our party but what be good for america in the spirit of jefferson let us affirm that in this chamber tonight there be no republican no democrat just american yes we will have our difference but let us always remember what unite us far outweigh whatever divide us that who send us here to serve them the million of american watch and listen tonight expect this of us let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy work even in a election year we've do this before and as we have work together to bring down spend tax rate and inflation employment have climb to record height america have create much job and good high pay job family income have rise for straight year and america's poor climb out of poverty at the fast rate in much than year our record be not just the long peacetime expansion in history but a economic and social revolution of hope base on work incentive growth and opportunity a revolution of compassion that lead to private sector initiative and a percent increase in charitable give a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaim and restore the american dream in international relation too there's only one description for what together we have achieve a complete turnabout a revolution seven year ago america be weak and freedom everywhere be under siege today america be strong and democracy be everywhere on the move from central america to east asia idea like free market and democratic reform and human right be take hold we've replace blame america with look up to america we've rebuild our defense and of all our accomplishment none can give us much satisfaction than know that our young people be again proud to wear our country's uniform and in a few moment i'm go to talk about three development arm reduction the strategic defense initiative and the global democratic revolution that when take together offer a chance none of us would have dare imagine year ago a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmare of the postwar era i speak of the startle hope of give our child a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror tonight then we're strong prosperous at peace and we be free this be the state of our union and if we will work together this year i believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity that peace that freedom not just the state of our union but the state of our world toward this end we have four basic objective tonight first step we can take this year to keep our economy strong and grow to give our child a future of low inflation and full employment 2 let's check our progress in attack social problem where important gain have be make but which still need critical attention i mean school that work economic independence for the poor restore respect for family life and family value our 3 objective tonight be global continue the excite economic and democratic revolution we've see around the world 4 and finally our nation have remain at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goal of world prosperity and world freedom we must protect that peace and deter war by make sure the next president inherit what you and i have a moral obligation to give that president a national security that be unassailable and a national defense that take full advantage of new technology and be fully fund this be a full agendum it's mean to be you see my think on the next year be quite simple let's make this the good of and that mean it's all out right to the finish line i don't buy the idea that this be the last year of anything because we're not talk here tonight about register temporary gain but way of make permanent our success and that's why our focus be the value the principle and idea that make america great let's be clear on this point we're for limit government because we understand as the found father do that it be the good way of ensure personal liberty and empower the individual so that every american of every race and region share fully in the flower of american prosperity and freedom one other thing we american like the future like the sound of it the idea of it the hope of it where other fear trade and economic growth we see opportunity for create new wealth and undreamed of opportunity for million in our own land and beyond where other seek to throw up barrier we seek to bring them down where other take counsel of their fear we follow our hope yes we american like the future and like make the much of it let's do that now and let's begin by discuss how to maintain economic growth by control and eventually eliminate the problem of federal deficit we have have a balance budget only eight time in the last year for the first time in year the federal government spend little in real term last year than the year before we take billion off last year's deficit compare to the year before the deficit itself have move from percent of the gross national product to only percent and perhaps the much important sign of progress have be the change in our view of deficit you know a few of us can remember when not too many year ago that who create the deficit say they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because we owe it to ourselves good at last there be agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich our recent budget agreement design to reduce federal deficit by billion over the next year build on this consensus but this agreement must be adhere to without slip into the error of the past much break promise and much unchecked spend as i indicate in my first state of the union what ail us can be simply put the federal government be too big and it spend too much money i can assure you the bipartisan leadership of congress of my help in fight off any attempt to bust our budget agreement and this include the swift and certain use of the veto power now it's also time for some plain talk about the much immediate obstacle to control federal deficit the simple but frustrate problem of make expense match revenue something american family do and the federal government can't have cause crisis after crisis in this city mr speaker mr president i will say to you tonight what i have say before and will continue to say the budget process have break down it need a drastic overhaul with each ensue year the spectacle before the american people be the same as it be this christmas budget deadline delay or miss completely monstrous continue resolution that pack hundred of billion of dollar worth of spend into one bill and a federal government on the brink of default i know i'm echo what you here in the congress have say because you suffer so directly but let's recall that in year of appropriation bill schedule to arrive on my desk by a certain date only make it on time last year of the appropriation bill due by october 1st none of them make it instead we have four continue resolution last day then day and day and day respectively and then along come this behemoth this be the conference report page report weigh pound then this a reconciliation bill month late that be page long weigh pound and the long term continue resolution this one be month late and it's page long weigh pound that be a total of pound of paper and ink you have hour yes hour to consider each and it take people at my office of management and budget just to read the bill so the government wouldn't shut down congress shouldn't send another one of this no and if you do i will not sign it let's change all this instead of a presidential budget that get discard and a congressional budget resolution that be not enforce why not a simple partnership a joint agreement that set out the spend priority within the available revenue and let's remember our deadline be october 1st not christmas let's get the people's work do in time to avoid a footrace with santa claus and yes this year to coin a phrase a new begin individual bill on time and fully review by congress i'm also certain you join me in say let's help ensure our future of prosperity by give the president a tool that though i will not get to use it be one i know future president of either party must have give the president the same authority that governor use in their state the right to reach into massive appropriation bill pare away the waste and enforce budget discipline let's approve the line item veto and let's take a partial step in this direction much of you in this chamber didn't know what be in this catchall bill and report over the past few week we've all learn what be tuck away behind a little comma here and there for example there's million for item such as cranberry research blueberry research the study of crawfish and the commercialization of wildflowers and that's not to mention the five or so million million that so that people from develop nation can come here to watch congress at work i won't even touch that so tonight i offer you this challenge in day i will send back to you that item as rescission which if i have the authority to line them out i would do so now review this multibillion dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement as a matter of fact if adopt it will improve our deficit reduction goal and what a example we can set that we're serious about get our financial account in order by act and approve this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that be out of control there be another vital reform yes gramm rudman hollings have be profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balance budget and make it permanent let us do now what so many state do to hold down spend and what state legislature have ask us to do let us heed the wish of a overwhelm plurality of american and pass a constitutional amendment that mandate a balance budget and force the federal government to live within its mean reform of the budget process include the line item veto and balance budget amendment will together with real restraint on government spend prevent the federal budget from ever again ravage the family budget let's ensure that the federal government never again legislate against the family and the home last september i sign a executive order on the family require that every department and agency review its activity in light of seven standard design to promote and not harm the family but let us make certain that the family be always at the center of the public policy process not just in this administration but in all future administration it's time for congress to consider at the begin a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of american society the family and speak of the family let's turn to a matter on the mind of every american parent tonight education we all know the sorry story of the sixty and seventy soar spend plummet test score and that hopeful trend of the eighty when we replace a obsession with dollar with a commitment to quality and test score start back up there's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred time in a child's education money can never take the place of basic like discipline hard work and yes homework as a nation we do of course spend heavily on education much than we spend on defense yet across our country governor like new jersey's tom kean be give classroom demonstration that how we spend be as important as how much we spend open up the teach profession to all qualify candidate merit pay so that good teacher get a's as good as apple and strong curriculum as secretary bennett have propose for high school this imaginative reform be make common sense the much popular new kid in america's school how can we help good we can talk about and push for this reform but the much important thing we can do be to reaffirm that control of our school belong to the state local community and much of all to the parent and teacher my friend some year ago the federal government declare war on poverty and poverty win today the federal government have major welfare program and spend much than billion a year on them what have all this money do good too often it have only make poverty hard to escape federal welfare program have create a massive social problem with the good of intention government create a poverty trap that wreak havoc on the very support system the poor need much to lift themselves out of poverty the family dependency have become the one endure heirloom pass from one generation to the next of too many fragment family it be time this may be the much radical thing i've say in year in this office it's time for washington to show a little humility there be a thousand spark of genius in state and a thousand community around the nation it be time to nurture them and see which one can catch fire and become guide light state have begin to show us the way they've demonstrate that successful welfare program can be build around much effective child support enforcement practice and innovative program require welfare recipient to work or prepare for work let us give the state much flexibility and encourage much reform let's start make our welfare system the first ring on america's ladder of opportunity a boost up from dependency not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope and now let me turn to three other matter vital to family value and the quality of family life the first be a untold american success story recently we release our annual survey of what graduate high school senior have to say about drug cocaine use be decline and marijuana use be the low since survey begin we can be proud that our student be just say no to drug but let us remember what this menace require commitment from every part of america and every single american a commitment to a drugfree america the war against drug be a war of individual battle a crusade with many hero include america's young people and also someone very special to me she have help so many of our young people to say no to drug nancy much credit belong to you and i want to express to you your husband's pride and your country's thank surprise you didn't i good now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront tonight i call america a good nation a moral people to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand to that who say this violate a woman's right to control of her own body can they deny that now medical evidence confirm the unborn child be a live human be entitle to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal fund for abortion and with a human life amendment make of course a exception where the unborn child threaten the life of the mother our judeo christian tradition recognize the right of take a life in self defense but with that one exception let us look to that other in our land who cry out for child to adopt i pledge to you tonight i will work to remove barrier to adoption and extend full share in family life to million of american so that child who need home can be welcome to family who want them and love them and let me add here so many of our great statesman have remind us that spiritual value alone be essential to our nation's health and vigor the congress open its proceeding each day as do the supreme court with a acknowledgment of the supreme be yet we be deny the right to set aside in our school a moment each day for that who wish to pray i believe congress should pass our school prayer amendment now to make sure there be a full nine member supreme court to interpret the law to protect the right of all american i urge the senate to move quickly and decisively in confirm judge anthony kennedy to the high court in the land and to also confirm nominee now wait to fill vacancy in the federal judiciary here then be our domestic priority yet if the congress and the administration work together even great opportunity lie ahead to expand a grow world economy to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arm and to extend the frontier of freedom and the growth of democratic institution our policy consistently receive the strong support of the late congressman dan daniel of virginia i'm sure all of you join me in express heartfelt condolence on his pass one of the great contribution the unite state can make to the world be to promote freedom as the key to economic growth a creative competitive america be the answer to a change world not trade war that would close door create great barrier and destroy million of job we should always remember protectionism be destructionism america's job america's growth america's future depend on trade trade that be free open and fair this year we have it within our power to take a major step toward a grow global economy and a expand cycle of prosperity that reach to all the free nation of this earth i'm speak of the historic free trade agreement negotiate between our country and canada and i can also tell you that we're determine to expand this concept south as good as north next month i will be travel to mexico where trade matter will be of foremost concern and over the next several month our congress and the canadian parliament can make the start of such a north american accord a reality our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade from the tip of tierra del fuego to the arctic circle unite the people of the western hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange when all border become what the u.s canadian border so long have be a meet place rather than a divide line this movement we see in so many place toward economic freedom be indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and against totalitarian rule this global democratic revolution have remove the specter so frighten a decade ago of democracy doom to permanent minority status in the world in south and central america only a 3 of the people enjoy democratic rule in today over percent of latin american live in nation commit to democratic principle and the resurgence of democracy be owe to this courageous people on almost every continent who have struggle to take control of their own destiny in nicaragua the struggle have extra mean because that nation be so near our own border the recent revelation of a former high level sandinista major roger miranda show us that even as they talk peace the communist sandinista government of nicaragua have establish plan for a large man army yet even as this plan be make the sandinista regime know the tide be turn and the cause of nicaraguan freedom be ride at its crest because of the freedom fighter who be resist communist rule the sandinistas have be force to extend some democratic right negotiate with church authority and release a few political prisoner the focus be on the sandinistas their promise and their action there be a consensus among the four central american democratic president that the sandinistas have not comply with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of central america the sandinistas again have promise reform their challenge be to take irreversible step toward democracy on wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighter will be submit which reflect our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in nicaragua i ask congress to pass this request let us be for the people of nicaragua what lafayette pulaski and von steuben be for our forefather and the cause of american independence so too in afghanistan the freedom fighter be the key to peace we support the mujahidin there can be no settlement unless all soviet troop be remove and the afghan people be allow genuine self determination i have make my view on this matter know to mr gorbachev but not just nicaragua or afghanistan yes everywhere we see a swell freedom tide across the world freedom fighter rise up in cambodia and angola fight and dying for the same democratic liberty we hold sacred their cause be our cause freedom yet even as we work to expand world freedom we must build a safe peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war but let's have no illusion three year of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increase the risk of our much basic security interest jeopardize early hard win goal we must face squarely the implication of this negative trend and make adequate stable defense spend a top goal both this year and in the future this same concern apply to economic and security assistance program as good but the resolve of america and its nato ally have open the way for unprecedented achievement in arm reduction our recently sign inf treaty be historic because it reduce nuclear arm and establish the much stringent verification regime in arm control history include several form of short notice on site inspection i submit the treaty today and i urge the senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement thank you very much in addition to the inf treaty we're within reach of a even much significant start agreement that will reduce u.s and soviet long range missile or strategic arsenal by half but let me be clear our approach be not to seek agreement for agreement's sake but to settle only for agreement that truly enhance our national security and that of our ally we will never put our security at risk or that of our ally just to reach a agreement with the soviet no agreement be good than a bad agreement as i mention early our effort be to give future generation what we never have a future free of nuclear terror reduction of strategic offensive arm be one step sdi another our fund request for our strategic defense initiative be little than percent of the total defense budget sdi fund be money wisely appropriate and money good spend sdi have the same purpose and support the same goal of arm reduction it reduce the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapon to all mankind strategic defense that threaten no one can offer the world a safe much stable basis for deterrence we must also remember that sdi be our insurance policy against a nuclear accident a chernobyl of the sky or a accidental launch or some madman who may come along we've see such change in the world in year as totalitarianism struggle to avoid be overwhelm by the force of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom it be the free nation that be resilient and resurgent as the global democratic revolution have put totalitarianism on the defensive we have leave behind the day of retreat america be again a vigorous leader of the free world a nation that act decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principle and vital interest no legacy would make me much proud than leave in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevent a paralysis of american power from ever occur again but my thought tonight go beyond this and i hope you'll let me end this even with a personal reflection you know the world can never be quite the same again after jacob shallus a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the pennsylvania general assembly take his pen and engross that word about representative government in the preamble of our constitution and in a quiet but final way the course of human event be forever alter when on a ridge overlook the emmitsburg pike in a obscure pennsylvania town call gettysburg lincoln speak of our duty to government of and by the people and never let it perish from the earth at the start of this decade i suggest that we live in equally momentous time that it be up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still have a place of greatness for a quiet pleasant greening land call america not everything have be make perfect in year nor will it be make perfect in seven time year but before us this year and beyond be great prospect for the cause of peace and world freedom it mean too that the young american i speak of year ago as good as that who may be come along the virginia or maryland shore this night and see for the first time the light of this capital city the light that cast their glow on our great hall of government and the monument to the memory of our great man it mean that young american will find a city of hope in a land that be free we can be proud that for them and for us as that light along the potomac be still see this night signal as they have for nearly two century and as we pray god they always will that another generation of american have protect and pass on lovingly this place call america this shine city on a hill this government of by and for the people thank you and god bless you mr speaker mr president and distinguish member of the house and senate honor guest and fellow citizen little than week ago i join you on the west front of this very build and look over the monument to our proud past offer you my hand in fill the next page of american history with a story of extend prosperity and continue peace and tonight i'm back to offer you my plan as good the hand remain extend the sleeve be roll up america be wait and now we must produce together we can build a good america it be comfort to return to this historic chamber here year ago i first raise my hand to be swear into public life so tonight i feel as if i'm return home to friend and i intend in the month and year to come to give you what friend deserve frankness respect and my good judgment about way to improve america's future in return i ask for a honest commitment to our common mission of progress if we seize the opportunity on the road before us there'll be praise enough for all the people didn't send us here to bicker and it's time to govern and many president have come to this chamber in time of great crisis war and depression loss of national spirit and year ago i sit in that very chair as president reagan speak of punish inflation and devastatingly high interest rate and people out of work american confidence on the wane and our challenge be different we're fortunate a much change landscape lie before us tonight so i don't propose to reverse direction we're head the right way but we cannot rest we're a people whose energy and drive have fuel our rise to greatness and we're a forward look nation generous yes but ambitious not for ourselves but for the world complacency be not in our character not before not now not ever and so tonight we must take a strong america and make it even good we must address some very real problem we must establish some very clear priority and we must make a very substantial cut in the federal budget deficit some people find that agendum impossible but i'm present to you tonight a realistic plan for tackle it my plan have four broad feature attention to urgent priority investment in the future a attack on the deficit and no new tax this budget represent my good judgment of how we can address our priority there be many area in which we would all like to spend much than i propose i understand that but we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order next year alone thank to economic growth without any change in the law the federal government will take in over billion much than it do this year that's right over billion in new revenue with no increase in tax and our job be to allocate that new resource wisely we can afford to increase spend by a modest amount but enough to invest in key priority and still cut the deficit by almost percent in year and that will allow us to meet the target set forth in the gramm rudman hollings law but to do that we must recognize that growth above inflation in federal program be not preordain that not all spend initiative be design to be immortal i make this pledge tonight my team and i be ready to work with the congress to form a special leadership group to negotiate in good faith to work day and night if that's what it take to meet the budget target and to produce a budget on time we cannot settle for business as usual government by continue resolution or government by crisis will not do and i ask the congress tonight to approve several measure which will make budget much sensible we can save time and improve efficiency by enact year budget forty three governor have the line item veto president should have it too and at the very less when a president propose to rescind federal spend the congress should be require to vote on that proposal instead of kill it by inaction and i ask the congress to honor the public's wish by pass a constitutional amendment to require a balance budget such a amendment once phase in will discipline both the congress and the executive branch several principle describe the kind of america i hope to build with your help in the year ahead we will not have the luxury of take the easy spendthrift approach to solve problem because high spend and high tax put economic growth at risk economic growth provide job and hope economic growth enable us to pay for social program economic growth enhance the security of the nation and low tax rate create economic growth i believe in give american great freedom and great choice and i will work for choice for american family whether in the house in which they live the school to which they send their child or the child care they select for their young you see i believe that we have a obligation to that in need but that government should not be the provider of first resort for thing that the private sector can produce good i believe in a society that be free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind and i will work to knock down the barrier leave by past discrimination and to build a much tolerant society that will stop such barrier from ever be build again i believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the nation and i'll work to make them strong for as benjamin franklin say if a sparrow cannot fall to the grind without his notice can a great nation rise without his aid and i believe in give people the power to make their own life good through growth and opportunity and together let's put power in the hand of people three week ago we celebrate the bicentennial inaugural the 200th anniversary of the first presidency and if you look back one thing be so strike about the way the found father look at america they didn't talk about themselves they talk about posterity they talk about the future and we too must think in term big than ourselves we must take action today that will ensure a good tomorrow we must extend american leadership in technology increase long term investment improve our educational system and boost productivity this be the key to build a good future and here be some of my recommendation i propose almost billion for the national science foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by i propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development i've ask vice president quayle to chair a new task force on competitiveness and i request fund for nasa national aeronautics and space administration and a strong space program a increase of almost billion over the current fiscal year we must have a man space station a vigorous safe space shuttle program and much commercial development in space the space program should always go full throttle up and that's not just our ambition it's our destiny i propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gain to increase long term investment history on this be clear this will increase revenue help saving and create new job we won't be competitive if we leave whole sector of america behind this be the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zone and bring hope to the inner city but the much important competitiveness program of all be one which improve education in america when some of our student actually have trouble locate america on a map of the world it be time for us to map a new approach to education we must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy we must help school that need help the much we must give choice to parent student teacher and principal and we must hold all concern accountable in education we cannot tolerate mediocrity i want to cut that dropout rate and make america a much literate nation because what it really come down to be this the long our graduation line be today the short our unemployment line will be tomorrow so tonight i'm propose the follow initiative the begin of a million program to reward america's good school merit school the creation of special presidential award for the good teacher in every state because excellence should be reward the establishment of a new program of national science scholar one each year for every member of the house and senate to give this generation of student a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics the expand use of magnet school which give family and student great choice and a new program to encourage alternative certification which will let talented people from all field teach in our classroom i've say i'd like to be the education president and tonight i'd ask you to join me by become the education congress just last week as i settle into this new office i receive a letter from a mother in pennsylvania who have be strike by my message in the inaugural address not hour before she write my husband and i receive word that our son be addict to cocaine he have the world at his foot bright gift personable he can have do anything with his life and now he have choose cocaine and please she write find a way to curb the supply of cocaine get tough with the pusher our son need your help my friend that voice cry out for help can be the voice of your own neighbor your own friend your own son over million american use illegal drug last year at a stagger cost to our nation's good be let this be record as the time when america rise up and say no to drug the scourge of drug must be stop and i be ask tonight for a increase of almost a billion dollar in budget outlay to escalate the war against drug the war must be wage on all front our new drug czar bill bennett and i will be shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch lead the charge some money will be use to expand treatment to the poor and to young mother this will offer the help hand to the many innocent victim of drug like the thousand of baby bear addict or with aid because of the mother's addiction some will be use to cut the wait time for treatment some money will be devote to that urban school where the emergency be now the bad and much of it will be use to protect our border with help from the coast guard and the custom service the department of state and justice and yes the u.s military i mean to get tough on the drug criminal and let me be clear this president will back up that who put their life on the line every single day our local police officer my budget ask for beef up prosecution for a new attack on organize crime and for enforcement of tough sentence and for the bad kingpin that mean the death penalty i also want to make sure that when a drug dealer be convict there's a cell wait for him and he should not go free because prison be too full and so let the word go out if you're catch and convict you will do time but for all we do in law enforcement in interdiction and treatment we will never win this war on drug unless we stop the demand for drug so some of this increase will be use to educate the young about the danger of drug we must involve the parent we must involve the teacher we must involve the community and my friend we must involve ourselves each and every one of us in this concern one problem relate to drug use demand our urgent attention and our continue compassion and that be the terrible tragedy of aid i'm ask for billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure if we're to protect our future we need a new attitude about the environment we must protect the air we breathe i will send to you shortly legislation for a new much effective clean air act it will include a plan to reduce by date certain the emission which cause acid rain because the time for study alone have pass and the time for action be now we must make use of clean coal my budget contain full fund on schedule for the clean coal technology agreement that we've make with canada we've make that agreement with canada and we intend to honor that agreement we must not neglect our park so i'm ask to fund new acquisition under the land and water conservation fund we must protect our ocean and i support new penalty against that who would dump medical waste and other trash into our ocean the age of the needle on the beach must end and in some case the gulf and ocean off our shore hold the promise of oil and gas reserve which can make our nation much secure and little dependent on foreign oil and when that with the much promise can be tap safely as with much of the alaska national wildlife refuge we should proceed but we must use caution we must respect the environment and so tonight i'm call for the indefinite postponement of three lease sale which have raise trouble question two off the coast of california and one which can threaten the everglades in florida action on this three lease sale will await the conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage i'm direct the attorney general and the administrator of the environmental protection agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our law against toxic waste dumper i want fast cleanups and tough enforcement of penalty against polluter in addition to care for our future we must care for that around us a decent society show compassion for the young the elderly the vulnerable and the poor our first obligation be to the much vulnerable infant poor mother child live in poverty and my propose budget recognize this i ask for full fund of medicaid a increase of over billion and a expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant woman who be near the poverty line i believe we should help work family cope with the burden of child care our help should be aim at that who need it much low income family with young child i support a new child care tax credit that will aim our effort at exactly that family without discriminate against mother who choose to stay at home now i know there be compete proposal but remember this the overwhelm majority of all preschool child care be now provide by relative and neighbor and church and community group family who choose this option should remain eligible for help parent should have choice and for that child who be unwanted or abuse or whose parent be decease we should encourage adoption i propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expense and to double it to let's make it easy for this kid to have parent who love them we have a moral contract with our senior citizen and in this budget social security be fully fund include a full cost of live adjustment we must honor our contract we must care about that in the shadow of life and i like many american be deeply trouble by the plight of the homeless the cause of homelessness be many the history be long but the moral imperative to act be clear thank to the deep good of generosity in this great land many organization already contribute but we in government cannot stand on the sideline in my budget i ask for great support for emergency food and shelter for health service and measure to prevent substance abuse and for clinic for the mentally ill and i propose a new initiative involve the full range of government agency we must confront this national shame there's another issue that i've decide to mention here tonight i've long believe that the people of puerto rico should have the right to determine their own political future personally i strongly favor statehood but i urge the congress to take the necessary step to allow the people to decide in a referendum certain problem the result of decade of unwise practice threaten the health and security of our people leave unattended they will only get bad but we can act now to put them behind us early this week i announce my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our saving system i ask congress to enact our reform proposal within day we must not let this situation fester we owe it to the saver in this country to solve this problem certainly the saving of american must remain secure let me be clear insure depositor will continue to be fully protect but any plan to refinance the system must be accompany by major reform our proposal will prevent such a crisis from recur the good answer be to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again the majority of thrifts in community across the nation have be honest they've play a major role in help family achieve the dream of home ownership but make no mistake that who be corrupt that who break the law must be kick out of the business and they should go to jail we face a massive task in clean up the waste leave from decade of environmental neglect at america's nuclear weapon plant clearly we must modernize this plant and operate them safely that's not at issue our national security depend on it but beyond that we must clean up the old mess that's be leave behind and i propose in this budget to much than double our current effort to do so this will allow us to identify the exact nature of the various problem so we can clean them up and clean them up we will we've be fortunate during this past year america be a strong nation than it be in morale in our arm force have be restore our resolve have be show our readiness have be improve and we be at peace there can no long be any doubt that peace have be make much secure through strength and when america be strong the world be safe much people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength the pentagon budget have actually be reduce in real term for each of the last year we cannot tolerate continue real reduction in defense in light of the compel need to reduce the deficit however i support a year freeze in the military budget something i propose last fall in my flexible freeze plan and this freeze will apply for only year and after that increase above inflation will be require i will not sacrifice american preparedness and i will not compromise american strength i should be clear on the condition attach to my recommendation for the come year the saving must be allocate to that priority for invest in our future that i've speak about tonight this defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meet the target spell out in gramm rudman hollings law without raise tax and which incorporate reform in the budget process i've direct the national security council to review our national security and defense policy and report back to me within day to ensure that our capability and resource meet our commitment and strategy i'm also charge the department of defense with the task of develop a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the pentagon one which will fully implement the packard commission report many of this change can only be make with the participation of the congress and so i ask for your help we need few regulation we need little bureaucracy we need multiyear procurement and year budget and frankly and don't take this wrong we need little congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy i detect a slight division on that question but nevertheless secure a much peaceful world be perhaps the much important priority i'd like to address tonight you know we meet at a time of extraordinary hope never before in this century have our value of freedom democracy and economic opportunity be such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe never before have our leadership be so crucial because while america have its eye on the future the world have its eye on america and it's a time of great change in the world and especially in the soviet union prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full mean of the change go on there review our policy and then proceed with caution but i've personally assure general secretary gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward we will not miss any opportunity to work for peace the fundamental fact remain that the soviet retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objective which be still too often in conflict with ours so let us take the new openness seriously but let's also be realistic and let's always be strong there be some press issue we must address i will vigorously pursue the strategic defense initiative the spread and even use of sophisticate weaponry threaten global security as never before chemical weapon must be ban from the face of the earth never to be use again and look this won't be easy verification extraordinarily difficult but civilization and human decency demand that we try and the spread of nuclear weapon must be stop and i'll work to strengthen the hand of the international atomic energy agency our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapon and around the globe we must continue to be freedom's good friend and we must stand firm for self determination and democracy in central america include in nicaragua it be my strongly hold conviction that when people be give the chance they inevitably will choose a free press freedom of worship and certifiably free and fair election we must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracy as solid a force for peace as the world have ever know and this be a alliance forge by the power of our ideal not the pettiness of our difference so let's lift our sight to rise above fight about beef hormone to build a good future to move from protectionism to progress i've ask the secretary of state to visit europe next week and to consult with our ally on the wide range of challenge and opportunity we face together include east west relation and i look forward to meet with our nato partner in the near future and i too shall begin a trip shortly to the far reach of the pacific basin where the wind of democracy be create new hope and the power of free market be unleash a new force when i serve as our representative in china or year ago few would have predict the scope of the change we've witness since then but in prepare for this trip i be strike by something i come across from a chinese writer he be speak of his country decade ago but his word speak to each of us in america tonight today he say we're afraid of the simple word like goodness and mercy and kindness my friend if we're to succeed as a nation we must rediscover that word in just day we mark the birthday of abraham lincoln the man who save our union and give new mean to the word opportunity lincoln once say i hold that while man exist it be his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorate that of mankind it be this broad mission to which i call all american because the definition of a successful life must include serve other and to the young people of america who sometimes feel leave out i ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program call yes for youth enter service to america to that man and woman in business remember the ultimate end of your work to make a good product to create good life i ask you to plan for the long term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profit to the brave man
