evil for the sake of good in a land so far away then surely we can make this land all that it should be if anyone tell you that america's good day be behind her they're look the wrong way tonight i come before this house and the american people with a appeal for renewal this be not merely a call for new government initiative it be a call for new initiative in government in our community and from every american to prepare for the next american century america have always lead by example so who among us will set the example which of our citizen will lead us in this next american century everyone who step forward today to get one addict off drug to convince one trouble teenager not to give up on life to comfort one aid patient to help one hungry child we have within our reach the promise of a renew america we can find mean and reward by serve some high purpose than ourselves a shine purpose the illumination of a thousand point of light and it be express by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand of a friend who stand by you and stay there a volunteer's generous gesture a idea that be simply right the problem before us may be different but the key to solve them remain the same it be the individual the individual who step forward and the state of our union be the union of each of us one to the other the sum of our friendship marriage family and community we all have something to give so if you know how to read find someone who can't if you've get a hammer find a nail if you're not hungry not lonely not in trouble seek out someone who be join the community of conscience do the hard work of freedom and that will define the state of our union since the birth of our nation we the people have be the source of our strength what government can do alone be limit but the potential of the american people know no limit we be a nation of rock solid realism and clear eye idealism we be american we be the nation that believe in the future we be the nation that can shape the future and we've begin to do just that by strengthen the power and choice of individual and family together this last year we've put dollar for child care directly in the hand of parent instead of bureaucracy unshackled the potential of american with disability apply the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment for clean air and make home ownership possible for much american the strength of a democracy be not in bureaucracy it be in the people and their community in everything we do let us unleash the potential of our much precious resource our citizen our citizen themselves we must return to family community county city state and institution of every kind the power to chart their own destiny and the freedom and opportunity provide by strong economic growth and that's what america be all about i know that tonight in some region of our country people be in genuine economic distress and i hear them early this month kathy blackwell of massachusetts write me about what can happen when the economy slow down say my heart be ache and i think that you should know your people out here be hurt badly i understand and i'm not unrealistic about the future but there be reason to be optimistic about our economy first we don't have to fight double digit inflation 2 much industry won't have to make big cut in production because they don't have big inventory pile up and 3 our export be run solid and strong in fact american business be export at a record rate so let's put this time in perspective together since we've create almost million job cut inflation in half and cut interest rate in half and yes the large peacetime economic expansion in history have be temporarily interrupt but our economy be still over twice as large as our close competitor we will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon we will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry us into the next american century we should focus our effort today on encourage economic growth invest in the future and give power and opportunity to the individual we must begin with control of federal spend that's why i'm submit a budget that hold the growth in spend to little than the rate of inflation and that's why amid all the sound and fury of last year's budget debate we put into law new enforceable spend cap so that future spend debate will mean a battle of idea not a bid war though controversial the budget agreement finally put the federal government on a pay as you go plan and cut the growth of debt by nearly billion and that free fund for save and job create investment now let's do much my budget again include tax free family saving account penalty free withdrawal from ira's for first time home buyer and to increase job and growth a reduce tax for long term capital gain i know there be difference among us about the impact and the effect of a capital gain incentive so tonight i'm ask the congressional leader and the federal reserve to cooperate with us in a study lead by chairman alan greenspan to sort out our technical difference so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bicker but just as our effort will bring economic growth now and in the future they must also be match by long term investment for the next american century that require a forward look plan of action and that's exactly what we will be send to the congress we've prepare a detail series of proposal that include a budget that promote investment in america's future in child education infrastructure space and high technology legislation to achieve excellence in education build on the partnership forge with the governor at the education summit enable parent to choose their children's school and help to make america numb one in math and science a blueprint for a new national highway system a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure a research and development agendum that include record level of federal investment and a permanent tax credit to strengthen private r have and to create job a comprehensive national energy strategy that call for energy conservation and efficiency increase development and great use of alternative fuel a bank reform plan to bring america's financial system into the 21st century so that our bank remain safe and secure and can continue to make job create loan for our factory our business and home buyer you know i do think there have be too much pessimism sound bank should be make sound loan now and interest rate should be low now in addition to this proposal we must recognize that our economic strength depend on be competitive in world market we must continue to expand american export a successful uruguay round of world trade negotiation will create much real job and much real growth for all nation you and i know that if the play field be level america's worker and farmer can out work out produce anyone anytime anywhere and with a mexican free trade agreement and our enterprise for the americas initiative we can help our partner strengthen their economy and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere the budget also include a plan of action right here at home to put much power and opportunity in the hand of the individual and that mean new incentive to create job in our inner city by encourage investment through enterprise zone it also mean tenant control and ownership of public house freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege of wealth they be the birthright of every american civil right be also crucial to protect equal opportunity every one of us have a responsibility to speak out against racism bigotry and hate we will continue our vigorous enforcement of exist statute and i will once again press the congress to strengthen the law against employment discrimination without resort to the use of unfair preference we're determine to protect another fundamental civil right freedom from crime and the fear that stalk our city the attorney general will soon convene a crime summit of our nation's law enforcement official and to help us support them we need tough crime control legislation and we need it now and as we fight crime we will fully implement our national strategy for combat drug abuse recent datum show that we be make progress but much remain to be do we will not rest until the day of the dealer be over forever good health care be every american's right and every american's responsibility and so we be propose a aggressive program of new prevention initiative for infant for child for adult and for the elderly to promote a healthy america and to help keep cost from spiral it's time to give people much choice in government by revive the ideal of the citizen politician who come not to stay but to serve and one of the reason that there be so much support across this country for term limitation be that the american people be increasingly concern about big money influence in politic so we must look beyond the next election to the next generation and the time have come to put the national interest above the special interest and to totally eliminate political action committee and that would truly put much competition in election and much power in the hand of individual and where power cannot be put directly in the hand of the individual it should be move close to the people away from washington the federal government too often treat government program as if they be of washington by washington and for washington once establish federal program seem to become immortal it's time for a much dynamic program life cycle some program should increase some should decrease some should be terminate and some should be consolidate and turn over to the state my budget include a list of program for potential turnover total much than billion work with congress and the governor i propose we select at less billion in such program and turn them over to the state in a single consolidate grant fully fund for flexible management by the state the value the value of this turnover approach be straightforward it allow the federal government to reduce overhead it allow state to manage much flexibly and much efficiently it move power and decisionmaking close to the people and it reinforce a theme of this administration appreciation and encouragement of the innovative power of state as laboratory this nation be found by leader who understand that power belong in the hand of people and they plan for the future and so must we here and all around the world as american we know that there be time when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictator toward the bright promise of a good day almost year ago we begin a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism now we face another define hour for america and the world there be no one much devote much commit to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor every marine airman and coastguardsman every man and woman now serve in the persian gulf oh how they deserve and what a fit tribute to them you see what a wonderful fit tribute to them each of them have volunteer volunteer to provide for this nation's defense and now they bravely struggle to earn for america for the world and for future generation a just and last peace our commitment to them must be equal to their commitment to their country they be truly america's fine the war in the gulf be not a war we want we work hard to avoid war for much than month we along with the arab league the european community the unite nation try every diplomatic avenue u.n secretary general perez de cuellar president gorbachev mitterrand ozal mubarak and bendjedid king fahd and hassan prime minister major and andreotti just to name a few all work for a solution but time and again saddam hussein flatly reject the path of diplomacy and peace the world good know how this conflict begin and when it begin on august 2d when saddam invade and sack a small defenseless neighbor and i be certain of how it

catalyst for peace in the region do not end with the successful conclusion of this war democracy bring the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent and we've hear some dissent voice here at home some a handful reckless much responsible but the fact that all voice have the right to speak out be one of the reason we've be unite in purpose and principle for year our progress in this great struggle be

gain advantage he be dead wrong if he think that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorism he be dead wrong and if he think that by abuse the coalition prisoner of war he will benefit he be dead wrong we will succeed in the gulf and when we do the world community will have send a endure warn to any dictator or despot present or future who contemplate outlaw aggression the world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long hold promise of a new world order where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance yes the unite state bear a major share of leadership in this effort among the nation of the world only the unite state of america have both the moral stand and the mean to back it up we're the only nation on this earth that can assemble the force of peace this be the burden of leadership and the strength that have make america the beacon of freedom in a search world this nation have never find glory in

world where we will never have to fight again each of us will measure within ourselves the value of this great struggle any cost in life any cost be beyond our power to measure but the cost of close our eye to aggression be beyond mankind's power to imagine this we do know our cause be just our cause be moral our cause be right let future generation understand the burden and the blessing of freedom let them say we stand where duty require us to stand let them know that together we affirm america and the world as a community of conscience the wind of change be with us now the force of freedom be together unite we move toward the next century much confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be do the hard work of freedom may god bless the unite state of america thank you very very much mr speaker and mr president distinguish member of congress honor guest and fellow citizen thank you very much for that warm reception you know with the big buildup this address have have i want to make sure it would be a big hit but i couldn't convince barbara to deliver it for me i see the speaker and the vice president be laugh they see what i do in japan and they're just happy they're sit behind me i mean to speak tonight of big thing of big change and the promise they hold and of some big problem and how together we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promise time in our history and in the history of man on earth for in the past month the world have know change of almost biblical proportion and even now month after the fail coup that doom a fail system i'm not sure we've absorb the full impact the full import of what happen but communism die this year even as president with the much fascinate possible vantage point there be time when i be so busy manage progress and help to lead change that i didn't always show the joy that be in my heart but the big thing that have happen in the world in my life in our life be this by the grace of god america win the cold war i mean to speak this even of the change that can take place in our country now that we can stop make the sacrifice we have to make when we have a avow enemy that be a superpower now we can look homeward even much and move to set right what need to be set right i will speak of that thing but let me tell you something i've be think this past few month it's a kind of rollcall of honor for the cold war didn't end it be win and i think of that who win it in place like korea and vietnam and some of them didn't come back back then they be hero but this year they be victor the long rollcall all the g.i joe and janes all the one who fight faithfully for freedom who hit the grind and suck the dust and know their share of horror this may seem frivolous and i don't mean it so but it's move to me how the world see them the world see not only their special valor but their special style their rambunctious optimistic bravery their do or die unity unhampered by class or race or region what a group we've put forth for generation now from the one who write kilroy be here on the wall of the german stalags to that who leave sign in the iraqi desert that say i see elvis what a group of kid we've send out into the world and there's another to be single out though it may seem inelegant and i mean a mass of people call the american taxpayer no one ever think to thank the people who pay a country's bill or a alliance's bill but for half a century now the american people have shoulder the burden and pay tax that be high than they would have be to support a defense that be big than it would have be if imperial communism have never exist but it do doesn't anymore and here's a fact i wouldn't mind the world acknowledge the american taxpayer bear the brunt of the burden and deserve a hunk of the glory so now for the first time in year our strategic bomber stand down no long be they on round the clock alert tomorrow our child will go to school and study history and how plant grow and they won't have as my child do air raid drill in which they crawl under their desk and cover their head in case of nuclear war my grandchild don't have to do that and won't have the bad dream child have once in decade past there be still threat but the long draw out dread be over a year ago tonight i speak to you at a moment of high peril american force have just unleash operation desert storm and after day in the desert sky and day on the grind the man and woman of america's arm force and our ally accomplish the goal that i declare and that you endorse we liberate kuwait soon after the arab world and israel sit down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace a historic first and soon after that at christmas the last american hostage come home our policy be vindicate much good can come from the prudent use of power and much good can come of this a world once divide into two arm camp now recognize one sole and preeminent power the unite state of america and they regard this with no dread for the world trust us with power and the world be right they trust us to be fair and restrain they trust us to be on the side of decency they trust us to do what's right i use that word advisedly a few day after the war begin i receive a telegram from joanne speicher the wife of the first pilot kill in the gulf lieutenant commander scott speicher even in her grief she want me to know that some day when her child be old enough she would tell them that their father go away to war because it be the right thing to do and she say it all it be the right thing to do and we do it together there be honest difference right here in this chamber but when the war begin you put partisanship aside and we support our troop this be still a time for pride but this be no time to boast for problem face us and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down two year ago i begin plan cut in military spend that reflect the change of the new era but now this year with imperial communism go that process can be accelerate tonight i can tell you of dramatic change in our strategic nuclear force this be action we be take on our own because they be the right thing to do after complete plane for which we have begin procurement we will shut down far production of the b bomber we will cancel the small icbm program we will cease production of new warhead for our sea base ballistic missile we will stop all new production of the peacekeeper missile and we will not purchase any much advance cruise missile this weekend i will meet at camp david with boris yeltsin of the russian federation i've inform president yeltsin that if the commonwealth the former soviet union will eliminate all land base multiple warhead ballistic missile i will do the follow we will eliminate all peacekeeper missile we will reduce the numb of warhead on minuteman missile to one and reduce the numb of warhead on our sea base missile by about one 3 and we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bomber to primarily conventional use president yeltsin's early response have be very positive and i expect our talk at camp david to be fruitful i want you to know that for half a century american president have long to make such decision and say such word but even in the midst of celebration we must keep caution as a friend for the world be still a dangerous place only the dead have see the end of conflict and though yesterday's challenge be behind us tomorrow's be be bear the secretary of defense recommend this cut after consultation with the joint chief of staff and i make them with confidence but do not misunderstand me the reduction i have approve will save us a additional billion over the next year by we will have cut defense by percent since i take office this cut be deep and you must know my resolve this deep and no deep to do little would be insensible to progress but to do much would be ignorant of history we must not go back to the day of the hollow army we cannot repeat the mistake make twice in this century when armistice be follow by recklessness and defense be purge as if the world be permanently safe i remind you this even that i have ask for your support in fund a program to protect our country from limit nuclear missile attack we must have this protection because too many people in too many country have access to nuclear arm and i urge you again to pass the strategic defense initiative sdi there be that who say that now we can turn away from the world that we have no special role no special place but we be the unite state of america the leader of the west that have become the leader of the world and as long as i be president i will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere not out of arrogance not out of altruism but for the safety and security of our child this be a fact strength in the pursuit of peace be no vice isolationism in the pursuit of security be no virtue and now to our trouble at home they're not all economic the primary problem be our economy there be some good sign inflation that thief be down and interest rate be down but unemployment be too high some industry be in trouble and growth be not what it should be let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart i know we're in hard time but i know something else this will not stand in this chamber in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we bring to desert storm and we can defeat hard time together i believe you'll help one reason be that you're patriot and you want the good for your country and i believe that in your heart you want to put partisanship aside and get the job do because it's the right thing to do the power of america rest in a stir but simple idea that people will do great thing if only you set them free good we're go to set the economy free for if this age of miracle and wonder have teach us anything it's that if we can change the world we can change america we must encourage investment we must make it easy for people to invest money and create new product new industry and new job we must clear away the obstacle to growth high tax high regulation redtape and yes wasteful government spend none of this will happen with a snap of the finger but it will happen and the test of a plan isn't whether it's call new or dazzle the american people aren't impress by gimmick they're smart on this score than all of us in this room the only test of a plan be be it sound and will it work we must have a short term plan to address our immediate need and heat up the economy and then we need a long term plan to keep combustion go and to guarantee our place in the world economy there be certain thing that a president can do without congress and i'm go to do them i have this even ask major cabinet department and federal agency to institute a day moratorium on any new federal regulation that can hinder growth in that day major department and agency will carry out a top to bottom review of all regulation old and new to stop the one that will hurt growth and speed up that that will help growth far for the untold numb of hard work responsible american worker and business man and woman who've be force to go without need bank loan the bank credit crunch must end i won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulation that serve the public good but regulatory overkill must be stop and i've instruct our government regulator to stop it i have direct cabinet department and federal agency to speed up progrowth expenditure as quickly as possible this should put a extra billion into the economy in the next month and our new transportation bill provide much than billion for construction and maintenance project that be vital to our growth and good be and that mean job build road job build bridge and job build railway and i have this even direct the secretary of the treasury to change the federal tax withhold table with this change million of american from whom the government withhold much than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold little from their paycheck something tell me a numb of taxpayer may take us up on this one this initiative can return about billion back into our economy over the next month money people can use to help pay for clothe college or to get a new car finally work with the federal reserve we will continue to support monetary policy that keep both interest rate and inflation down now this be the thing i can do and now member of congress let me tell you what you can do for your country you must pass the other element of my plan to meet our economic need everyone know that investment spur recovery i be propose this even a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new percent investment tax allowance this will encourage business to accelerate investment and bring people back to work real estate have lead our economy out of almost all the tough time we've ever have once build start carpenter and plumber work people buy home and take out mortgage my plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developer and it would make it easy for pension plan to purchase real estate for that american who dream of buy a first home but who can't quite afford it my plan would allow first time homebuyer to withdraw saving from ira's without penalty and provide a tax credit for the first purchase of that home and finally my immediate plan call on congress to give crucial help to people who own a home to everyone who have a business or a farm or a single investment this time at this hour i cannot take no for a answer you must cut the capital gain tax on the people of our country never have a issue be much demagogued by its opponent but the demagogs be wrong they be wrong and they know it sixty percent of the people who benefit from low capital gain have income under a cut in the capital gain tax increase job and help just about everyone in our country and so i'm ask you to cut the capital gain tax to a maximum of percent i'll tell you that of you who say oh no someone who's comfortable may benefit from that you kind of remind me of the old definition of the puritan who couldn't sleep at night worry that somehow someone somewhere be out have a good time the opponent of this measure and that who have author various so call soak the rich bill that be float around this chamber should be remind of something when they aim at the big guy they usually hit the little guy and maybe it's time that stop this then be my short term plan your part member of congress require enactment of this commonsense proposal that will have a strong effect on the economy without break the budget agreement and without raise tax rate while my plan be be pass and kick in we've get to care for that in trouble today i have provide for up to billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefit and i ask for congressional action right away and i thank the committee good at last let's be frank let's be frank let me level with you i know and you know that my plan be unveil in a political season i know and you know that everything i propose will be view by some in merely partisan term but i ask you to know what be in my heart and my aim be to increase our nation's good i'm do what i think be right and i be propose what i know will help i pride myself that i'm a prudent man and i believe that patience be a virtue but i understand that politic be for some a game and that sometimes the game be to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement but let me tell you far much important than my political future and far much important than yours be the good be of our country member of this chamber be practical people and i know you won't resend some practical advice when people put their party's fortune whatever the party whatever side of this aisle before the public good they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves and they will certainly deserve it i submit my plan tomorrow and i'm ask you to pass it by march 20th and i ask the american people to let you know they want this action by march 20th from the day after that if it must be the battle be join and you know when principle be at stake i relish a good fair fight i say my plan have two part and it do and it's the 2 part that be the heart of the matter for it's not enough to get a immediate burst we need long term improvement in our economic position we all know that the key to our economic future be to ensure that america continue as a economic leader of the world we have that in our power here then be my long term plan to guarantee our future first trade we will work to break down the wall that stop world trade we will work to open market everywhere and in our major trade negotiation i will continue push to eliminate tariff and subsidy that damage america's farmer and worker and we'll get much good american job within our own hemisphere through the north american free trade agreement and through the enterprise for the americas initiative but change be here and much be come the workplace of the future will demand much highly skill worker than ever much people who be computer literate highly educate we must be the world's leader in education and we must revolutionize america's school my america strategy will help us reach that goal my plan will give parent much choice give teacher much flexibility and help community create new american school thirty state across the nation have establish america program hundred of city and town have join in now congress must join this great movement pass my proposal for new american school that be my 2 long term proposal and here's my 3 we must make commonsense investment that will help us compete long term in the marketplace we must encourage research and development my plan be to make the r have tax credit permanent and to provide record level of support over billion this year alone for people who will explore the promise of emerge technology 4 we must do something about crime and drug it be time for a major renew investment in fight violent street crime it sap our strength and hurt our faith in our society and in our future together surely a tire woman on her way to work at in the morning on a subway deserve the right to get there safely and surely it's true that everyone who change his or her life because of crime from that afraid to go out at night to that afraid to walk in the park they pay for surely this people have be deny a basic civil right it be time to restore it congress pass my comprehensive crime bill it be tough on criminal and supportive of police and it have be languish in this hallow hall for year now pass it help your country 5 i ask you tonight to fund our hope house proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get business into the inner city we must empower the poor with the pride that come from own a home get a job become a part of thing my plan would encourage real estate construction by extend tax incentive for mortgage revenue bond and low income house and i ask tonight for record expenditure for the program that help child bear into want move into excellence head start step six we must reform our health care system for this too bear on whether or not we can compete in the world american health cost have be explode this year america will spend over billion on health and that be expect to grow to trillion by the end of the decade we simply cannot afford this the cost of health care show up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell when health coverage for a fellow on a assembly line cost thousand of dollar the cost go into the product he make and you pay the bill we must make a choice now some pretend we can have it both way they call it play or pay but that expensive approach be unstable it will mean high tax few job and eventually a system under complete government control really there be only two option and we can move toward a nationalize system a system which will restrict patient choice in pick a doctor and force the government to ration service arbitrarily and what we'll get be patient in long line indifferent service and a huge new tax burden or we can reform our own private health care system which still give us for all its flaw the good quality health care in the world good let's build on our strength my plan provide insurance security for all american while preserve and increase the idea of choice we make basic health insurance affordable for all low income people not now cover and we do it by provide a health insurance tax credit of up to for each low income family and the middle class get help too and by reform the health insurance market my plan assure that american will have access to basic health insurance even if they change job or develop serious health problem we must bring cost under control preserve quality preserve choice and reduce the people's nag daily worry about health insurance my plan the detail of which i'll announce very shortly do just that 7 we must get the federal deficit under control we now have in law enforceable spend cap and a requirement that we pay for the program we create there be that in congress who would ease that discipline now but i cannot let them do it and i won't my plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which mean no much next year than this year i will not tamper with social security but i would put real cap on the growth of uncontrolled spend and i would also freeze federal domestic government employment and with the help of congress my plan will get rid of program that don't deserve federal fund some of them have noble title but none of them be indispensable we can get rid of each and every one of them you know it's time we rediscover a home truth the american people have never forget this government be too big and spend too much and i call upon congress to adopt a measure that will help put a end to the annual ritual of fill the budget with pork barrel appropriation every year the press have a field day make fun of outrageous example a lawrence welk museum research grant for belgian endive we all know how this thing get into the budget and maybe you need someone to help you say no i know how to say it and i know what i need to make it stick give me the same thing governor have the line item veto and let me help you control spend we must put a end to unfinanced federal government mandate this be the requirement congress put on our city county and state without supply the money if congress pass a mandate it should be force to pay for it and balance the cost with saving elsewhere after all a mandate just increase someone else's burden and that mean high tax at the state and local level step eight congress should enact the bold reform proposal that be still await congressional action bank reform civil justice reform tort reform and my national energy strategy and finally we must strengthen the family because it be the family that have the great bear on our future when barbara hold a aid baby in her arm and read to child she's say to every person in this country family matter and i be announce tonight a new commission on america's urban family i've ask missouri's governor john ashcroft to be chairman former dallas mayor annette strauss to be cochair you know i have mayor the lead mayor from the league of city in the other day at the white house and they tell me something strike they say that every one of them republican or democrat agree on one thing that the major cause of the problem of the city be the dissolution of the family they ask for this commission and they be right to ask because it's time to determine what we can do to keep family together strong and sound there's one thing we can do right away ease the burden of rear a child i ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by per child for every family for a family with four kid that's a increase of this be a good start in the right direction and it's what we can afford it's time to allow family to deduct the interest they pay on student loan i be ask you to do just that and i'm ask you to allow people to use money from their ira's to pay medical and education expense all without penalty and i'm ask for much ask american parent what they dislike about how thing be go in our country and chance be good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare american be the much generous people on earth but we have to go back to the insight of franklin roosevelt who when he speak of what become the welfare program warn that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit welfare be never mean to be a lifestyle it be never mean to be a habit it be never suppose to be pass from generation to generation like a legacy it's time to replace the assumption of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system state throughout the country be begin to operate with new assumption that when able bodied people receive government assistance they have responsibility to the taxpayer a responsibility to seek work education or job train a responsibility to get their life in order a responsibility to hold their family together and refrain from have child out of wedlock and a responsibility to obey the law we be go to help this movement often state reform require waive certain federal regulation i will act to make that process easy and quick for every state that ask for our help i want to add as we make this change we work together to improve this system that our intention be not scapegoat or finger point if you read the paper and watch tv you know there's be a rise this day in a certain kind of ugliness racist comment anti semitism a increase sense of division really this be not us this be not who we be and this be not acceptable and so you have my plan for america and i'm ask for big thing but i believe in my heart you'll do what's right you know it's kind of a american tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institution i myself have sometimes think the age process can be delay if it have to make its way through congress you will deliberate and you will discuss and that be fine but my friend the people cannot wait they need help now there's a mood among us people be worry there's be talk of decline someone even say our worker be lazy and uninspired and i think really you go tell neil armstrong stand on the moon tell the man and woman who put him there tell the american farmer who feed his country and the world tell the man and woman of desert storm mood come and go but greatness endure ours do and maybe for a moment it's good to remember what in the dailiness of our life we forget we be still and ever the free nation on earth the kind nation on earth the strong nation on earth and we have always rise to the occasion and we be go to lift this nation out of hard time inch by inch and day by day and that who would stop us have good step aside because i look at hard time and i make this vow this will not stand and so we move on together a rise nation the once and future miracle that be still this night the hope of the world thank you god bless you and god bless our beloved country thank you very very much mr president mr speaker member of the house and the senate distinguish american here as visitor in this chamber as be i it be nice to have a fresh excuse for give a long speech when president speak to congress and the nation from this podium typically they comment on the full range in challenge and opportunity that face the unite state but this be not a ordinary time and for all the many task that require our attention i believe tonight one call on us to focus to unite and to act and that be our economy for much than anything else our task tonight as american be to make our economy thrive again let me begin by say that it have be too long at less three decade since a president have come and challenge american to join him on a great national journey not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much great one tomorrow like individual nation must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves how they wish to be think of by that with whom they live and late how they wish to be judge by history like every individual man and woman nation must decide whether they be prepare to rise to the occasion history present them we have always be a people of youthful energy and dare spirit and at this historic moment as communism have fall as freedom be spread around the world as a global economy be take shape before our eye american have call for change and now it be up to that of us in this room to deliver for them our nation need a new direction tonight i present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course i believe we will find our new direction in the basic old value that bring us here over the last two century a commitment to opportunity to individual responsibility to community to work to family and to faith we must now break the habit of both political party and say there can be no much something for nothing and admit frankly that we be all in this together the condition which bring us as a nation to this point be good know two decade of low productivity growth and stagnant wage persistent unemployment and underemployment year of huge government deficit and decline investment in our future explode health care cost and lack of coverage for million of american legion of poor child education and job train opportunity inadequate to the demand of this tough global economy for too long we have drift without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community and our political system so often have seem paralyze by special interest group by partisan bicker and by the sheer complexity of our problem i believe we can do good because we remain the great nation on earth the world's strong economy the world's only military superpower if we have the vision the will and the heart to make the change we must we can still enter the 21st century with possibility our parent can not even have imagine and enter it have secure the american dream for ourselves and for future generation i good remember year ago president reagan stand at this very podium and tell you and the american people that if our national debt be stack in thousand dollar bill the stack would reach mile into space good today that stack would reach mile i tell you this not to assign blame for this problem there be plenty of blame to go around in both branch of the government and both party the time have come for the blame to end i do not seek this office to place blame i come here tonight to accept responsibility and i want you to accept responsibility with me and if we do right by this country i do not care who get the credit for it the plan i offer you have four fundamental component first it shift our emphasis in public and private spend from consumption to investment initially by jumpstarting the economy in the short term and invest in our people their job and their income over the long run 2 it change the rhetoric of the past into the action of the present by honor work and family in every part of our public decision make 3 it substantially reduce the federal deficit honestly and credibly by use in the begin the much conservative estimate of government revenue not as the executive branch have do so often in the past use the much optimistic one and finally it seek to earn the trust of the american people by pay for this plan first with cut in government waste and efficiency 2 with cut not gimmick in government spend and by fairness for a change in the way additional burden be bear tonight i want to talk with you about what government can do because i believe government must do much but let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country be the private sector and 2 that each of us must be a engine of growth and change the truth be that as government create much opportunity in this new and different time we must also demand much responsibility in turn our immediate priority must be to create job create job now some people say good we're in a recovery and we don't have to do that good we all hope we're in a recovery but we're sure not create new job and there's no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the american people back to work to create job and guarantee a strong recovery i call on congress to enact a immediate package of job investment of over billion to put people to work now to create a half a million job job to rebuild our highway and airport to renovate house to bring new life to rural community and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth especially i want to emphasize after the event of last year in los angeles and the countless story of despair in our city and in our poor rural community this proposal will create almost new summer job for displace unemployed young people alone this summer and tonight i invite america's business leader to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer job in city and poor rural area for our young people 2 our plan look beyond today's business cycle because our aspiration extend into the next century the heart of this plan deal with the long term it be a investment program design to increase public and private investment in area critical to our economic future and it have a deficit reduction program that will increase the saving available for the private sector to invest will low interest rate will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claim by interest payment and decrease the risk of financial market disruption that can adversely affect our economy over the long run all this will bring us a high rate of economic growth improve productivity much high quality job and a improve economic competitive position in the world in order to accomplish both increase investment and deficit reduction something no american government have ever be call upon to do at the same time before spend must be cut and tax must be raise the spend cut i recommend be carefully think through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact to capture the peace dividend for investment purpose and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to much investment the tax increase and the spend cut be both design to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problem will be bear by that who can readily afford it the much our plan be design furthermore and perhaps in some way much importantly to improve the health of american business through low interest rate much incentive to invest and good train worker because small business have create such a high percentage of all the new job in our nation over the last or year our plan include the bold target incentive for small business in history we propose a permanent investment tax credit for the small firm in this country with revenue of under million that's about percent of the firm in america employ about percent of the work force but create a big majority of the net new job for much than a decade and we propose new reward for entrepreneur who take new risk we propose to give small business access to all the new technology of our time and we propose to attack this credit crunch which have deny small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper with a new network of community development bank and billion to make the dream of enterprise zone real we propose to bring new hope and new job to storefront and factory from south boston to south texas to south central los angeles this plan invest in our road our bridge our transit system in high speed railway and high tech information system and it provide the much ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future stand as we be on the edge of a new century we know that economic growth depend as never before on open up new market overseas and expand the volume of world trade and so we will insist on fair trade rule in international market as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade include the successful completion of the late round of world trade talk and the successful completion of a north american free trade agreement with appropriate safeguard for our worker and for the environment at the same time and i say this to you in both party and across america tonight all the people who be listen it be not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement this world be change so fast that we must have aggressive target attempt to create the high wage job of the future that's what all our competitor be do we must give special attention to that critical industry that be go to explode in the 21st century but that be in trouble in america today like aerospace we must provide special assistance to area and to worker displace by cut in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocation and again i will say we must do this together i pledge to you that i will do my good to see that business and labor and government work together for a change but all of our effort to strengthen the economy will fail let me say this again i feel so strongly about this all of our effort to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year not next year not year from now but this year bold step to reform our health care system in we spend percent of our income on health care much than percent much than any other country in the world and yet we be the only advance nation that do not provide a basic package of health care benefit to all of its citizen unless we change the present pattern percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year will be in health care cost by the year almost percent of our income will be in health care our family will never be secure our business will never be strong and our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis we must do it this year the combination of the rise cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of lose care be endanger the security and the very life of million of our people and they be weaken our economy every day reduce health care cost can liberate literally hundred of billion of dollar for new investment in growth and job bring health cost in line with inflation would do much for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we can give and any spend program we can promote reform health care over the long run be critically essential to reduce not only our deficit but to expand investment in america late this spring after the first lady and the many good people who be help her all across the country complete their work i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring cost under control and provide security to all of our family so that no one will be deny the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromise either we'll have to root out fraud and overcharge and make sure that paperwork no long choke your doctor we'll have to maintain the high american standard and the right to choose in a system that be the world's fine for all that who can access it but first we must make choice we must choose to give the american people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or far drive much american into agony let me far say that i want to work with all of you on this i realize this be a complicate issue but we must address it and i believe if there be any chance that republican and democrat who disagree on tax and spend or anything else can agree on one thing surely we can all look at this number and go home and tell our people the truth we cannot continue this spend pattern in public or private dollar for health care for little and little and little every year we can do good and i will work to do good perhaps the much fundamental change the new direction i propose offer be its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our child each day we delay really make a commitment to our child carry a dear cost half of the year old in this country today don't receive the immunization they need against deadly disease our plan will provide them for every eligible child and we know now that we will save late for every we spend by eliminate preventable childhood disease that's a good investment no matter how you measure it i recommend that the woman infant and children's nutrition program be expand so that every expectant mother who need the help get it we all know that head start a program that prepare child for school be a success story we all know that it save money but today it just reach barely over one 3 of all the eligible child under this plan every eligible child will be able to get a head start this be not just the right thing to do it be the smart thing to do for every dollar we invest today we'll save tomorrow we have to start think about tomorrow i've hear that somewhere before we have to ask much in our school of our student our teacher our principal our parent yes we must give them the resource they need to meet high standard but we must also use the authority and the influence and the fund of the education department to promote strategy that really work in learn money alone be not enough we have to do what really work to increase learn in our school we have to recognize that all of our high school graduate need some far education in order to be competitive in this global economy so we have to establish a partnership between business and education and the government for apprenticeship program in every state in this country to give our people the skill they need lifelong learn must benefit not just young high school graduate but worker too throughout their career the average year old today will change job seven time in a lifetime we have do a lot in this country on worker train in the last few year but the system be too fracture we must develop a unify simplify sensible streamline worker train program so that worker receive the train they need regardless of why they lose their job or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them we have get to do good on this and finally i propose a program that get a great response from the american people all across this country last year a program of national service to make college loan available to all american and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teacher or police officer or community service worker to give them the option to pay the loan back but at tax time so they can't beat the bill but to encourage them instead to pay it back by make their country strong and make their country good and give us the benefit of their knowledge a generation ago when president kennedy propose and the unite state congress embrace the peace corp it define the character of a whole generation of american commit to serve people around the world in this national service program we will provide much than twice as many slot for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever serve in the peace corp this program can do for this generation of member of congress what the land grant college act do and what the gi bill do for former congressman in the future historian who get their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for give america a new lease on life if you meet this challenge if we believe in job and we believe in learn we must believe in reward work if we believe in restore the value that make america special we must believe that there be dignity in all work and there must be dignity for all worker to that who care for our sick who tend our child who do our much difficult and tire job the new direction i propose will make this solemn simple commitment by expand the refundable earn income tax credit we will make history we will reward the work of million of work poor american by realize the principle that if you work hour a week and you've get a child in the house you will no long be in poverty late this year we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it i have work on this issue for the good part of a decade and i know from personal conversation with many people that no one no one want to change the welfare system as badly as that who be trap in it i want to offer the people on welfare the education the train the child care the health care they need to get back on their foot but say after year they must get back to work too in private business if possible in public service if necessary we have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity our next great goal should be to strengthen our family i compliment the congress for pass the family and medical leave act as a good first step but it be time to do much this plan will give this country the tough child support enforcement system it have ever have it be time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring in this world and i ask you to help to protect our family against the violent crime which terrorize our people and which tear our community apart we must pass a tough crime bill i support not only the bill which didn't quite make it to the president's desk last year but also a initiative to put much police officer on the street to provide boot camp for first time nonviolent offender for much space for the harden criminal in jail and i support a initiative to do what we can to keep gun out of the hand of criminal let me say this i will make you this bargain if you will pass the brady bill i'll sure sign it let me say now we should move to the hard part i think it be clear to every american include every member of congress of both party that the confidence of the people who pay our bill in our institution in washington be not high we must restore it we must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayer not simply for organize interest group and that begin must start with real political reform i be ask the unite state congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year i ask you to increase the participation of the american people by pass the motor voter bill promptly i ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interest by pass a bill to end the tax deduction for lobby and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyist by pass the lobby registration bill believe me they be cheer that last section at home i believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform be a sure path to increase popularity for republican and democrat alike because it say to the voter back home this be your house this be your senate we're your hire hand and every penny we draw be your money next to revolutionize government we have to ensure that we live within our mean and that should start at the top and with the white house in the last few day i have announce a cut in the white house staff of percent save approximately million i have order administrative cut in budget of agency and department i have cut the federal bureaucracy or will over the next year by approximately position for a combine saving of billion it be time for government to demonstrate in the condition we're in that we can be as frugal as any household in america and that's why i also want to congratulate the congress i notice the announcement of the leadership today that congress be take similar step to cut its cost i think that be important i think it will send a very clear signal to the american people but if we really want to cut spend we're go to have to do much and some of it will be difficult tonight i call for a across the board freeze in federal government salary for one year and thereafter during this year period i recommend that salary rise at one point low than the cost of live allowance normally involve in federal pay increase next i recommend that we make specific budget cut as you know and that all that who say we should cut much be as specific as i have be finally let me say to my friend on both side of the aisle it be not enough simply to cut government we have to rethink the whole way it work when i become president i be amaze at just the way the white house work in way that add lot of money to what taxpayer have to pay outmoded way that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do thing that any business would have do year ago to save taxpayer money so i want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department i want to push education reform as i say not just to spend much money but to really improve learn some thing work and some thing don't we ought to be subsidize the thing that work and discourage the thing that don't i'd like to use that superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyer in the aftermath of all the difficulty with the saving and loan we must use federal bank regulator to protect the security and safety of our financial institution but they should not be use to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from make sensible loan i'd like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our program that help people to shift them from entitlement program to empowerment program in the end we want people not to need us anymore i think that's important but in the end we have to get back to the deficit for year there's be a lot of talk about it but very few credible effort to deal with it and now i understand why have deal with the real number for week but i believe this plan do it tackle the budget deficit seriously and over the long term it put in place one of the big deficit reduction and one of the big change in federal priority from consumption to investment in the history of this country at the same time over the next year let me say to all the people watch us tonight who will ask me this question begin tomorrow as i go around the country and who've ask it in the past we're not cut the deficit just because expert say it's the thing to do or because it have some intrinsic merit we have to cut the deficit because the much we spend pay off the debt the little tax dollar we have to invest in job and education and the future of this country and the much money we take out of the pool of available saving the hard it be for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rate for a college loan for their child for a home mortgage or to start a new business that's why we've get to reduce the debt because it be crowd out other activity that we ought to be engage in and that the american people ought to be engage in we cut the deficit so that our child will be able to buy a home so that our company can invest in the future and in retrain their worker so that our government can make the kind of investment we need to be a strong and smart and safe nation if we don't act now you and i may not even recognize this government year from now if we just stay with the same trend of the last year by the end of the decade the deficit will be billion a year almost percent of our gross domestic product and pay interest on that debt will be the costly government program of all we'll still be the world's large debtor and when member of congress come here they'll be devote over cent on the dollar to interest payment much than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlement and you'll come here and deliberate and argue over or cent on the dollar no matter what america's problem be we will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign fund for a large portion of our investment this budget plan by contrast will by cut billion in that year alone from the deficit a real spend cut a real revenue increase a real deficit reduction use the independent number of the congressional budget office good you can laugh my fellow republican but i'll point out that the congressional budget office be normally much conservative in what be go to happen and close to right than previous president have be i do this so that we can argue about priority with the same set of number i do this so that no one can say i be estimate my way out of this difficulty i do this because if we can agree together on the much prudent revenue we're likely to get if the recovery stay and we do right thing economically then it will turn out good for the american people than we say in the last year because there be difference over the revenue estimate you and i know that both party be give great elbow room for irresponsibility this be tighten the rein on the democrat as good as the republican let's at less argue about the same set of number so the american people will think we're shoot straight with them as i say early my recommendation make much than difficult reduction to cut the federal spend by a total of billion we be eliminate program that be no long need such as nuclear power research and development we're slash subsidy and cancel wasteful project but many of this program be justify in their time and a lot of them be difficult for me to recommend reduction in some really tough one for me personally i recommend that we reduce interest subsidy to the rural electric administration that's a difficult thing for me to recommend but i think that i cannot exempt the thing that exist in my state or in my experience if i ask you to deal with thing that be difficult for you to deal with we're go to have to have no sacred cow except the fundamental abide interest of the american people i have to say that we all know our government have be just great at build program the time have come to show the american people that we can limit them too that we can not only start thing that we can actually stop thing about the defense budget i raise a hope and a caution as we restructure our military force to meet the new threat of the post cold war world it be true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget and we may all doubt what that range of reduction be but let me say that as long as i be president i will do everything i can to make sure that the man and woman who serve under the american flag will remain the good train the good prepare the good equip fight force in the world and every one of you should make that solemn pledge we still have responsibility around the world we be the world's only superpower this be still a dangerous and uncertain time and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interest and need back by a effective national defense and a strong economy our nation will be prepare to lead a world challenge as it be everywhere by ethnic conflict by the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction by the global democratic revolution and by challenge to the health of our global environment i know this economic plan be ambitious but i honestly believe it be necessary for the continue greatness of the unite state and i think it be pay for fairly first by cut government then by ask the much of that who benefit the much in the past and by ask much american to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow for the wealthy that earn much than per year i ask you all who be listen tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income tax from to percent we recommend a percent surtax on income over a year and we recommend close some loophole that let some people get away without pay any tax at all for business with taxable income in excess of million we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate also to percent as good as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expense our plan seek to attack tax subsidy that actually reward company much for shut their operation down here and move them overseas than for stay here and reinvest in america i say that as someone who believe that american company should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively seek investment of foreign company in my state but the tax code should not express a preference to american company for move somewhere else and it do in particular case today we will seek to ensure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporation who do make money in america simply pay the same tax that american company make on the same income to middle class american who have pay a great deal for the last year and from whom i ask a contribution tonight i will say again as i do on monday night you're not go alone any much you're certainly not go first and you're not go to pay much for little as you have too often in the past i want to emphasize the fact about this plan percent of america's family will have no increase in their income tax rate only percent at the top let me be clear there will also be no new cut in benefit for medicare as we move toward the 4th year with the explosion in health care cost as i say project to account for percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year there must be plan cut in payment to provider to doctor to hospital to lab as a way of control health care cost but i see this only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system if you'll help me do that we can be fair to the provider and to the consumer of health care let me repeat this because i know it matter to a lot of you on both side of the aisle this plan do not make a recommendation for new cut in medicare benefit for any beneficiary secondly the only change we be make in social security be one that have already be publicize the plan do ask old american with high income who do not rely solely on social security to get by to contribute much this plan will not affect the percent of social security recipient who do not pay tax on social security now that who do not pay tax on social security now will not be affect by this plan our plan do include a broad base tax on energy and i want to tell you why i select this and why i think it's a good idea i recommend that we adopt a btu tax on the heat content of energy as the good way to provide us with revenue to low the deficit because it also combat pollution promote energy efficiency promote the independence economically of this country as good as help to reduce the debt and because it do not discriminate against any area unlike a carbon tax that's not too hard on the coal state unlike a gas tax that's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work unlike a ad valorem tax it doesn't increase just when the price of a energy source go up and it be environmentally responsible it will help us in the future as good as in the present with the deficit take together this measure will cost a american family with a income of about a year little than a month it will cost american family with income under nothing because of other program we propose principally that raise the earn income tax credit because of our publicly state determination to reduce the deficit if we do this thing we will see the continuation of what's happen just since the election just since the election since the secretary of the treasury the director of the office of management and budget and other who have begin to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan interest rate have continue to fall long term that mean that for the middle class who will pay something much each month if they have any credit need or demand their increase energy cost will be much than offset by low interest cost for mortgage consumer loan credit card this can be a wise investment for them and their country now i would also point out what the american people already know and that be because we're a big vast country where we drive long distance we have maintain far low burden on energy than any other advance country we will still have far low burden on energy than any other advance country and this will be spread fairly with real attempt to make sure that no cost be impose on family with income under and that the cost be very modest until you get into the high income group where the income tax trigger in now i ask all of you to consider this whatever you think of the tax program whatever you think of the spend cut consider the cost of not change remember the number that you all know if we just keep on do what we're do by the end of the decade we'll have a billion a year deficit if we just keep on do what we're do by the end of the decade percent of our national income will go to health care every year twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe if we just keep on do what we're do over cent on the dollar will have to go to service the debt unless we have the courage now to start build our future and stop borrow from it we're condemn ourselves to year of stagnation interrupt by occasional recession to slow growth in job to no much growth in income to much debt to much disappointment bad unless we change unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both job and income we will be condemn our child and our children's child to a lesser life than we enjoy once american look forward to double their live standard every year at present productivity rate it will take year to double live standard until our grandchildren's grandchild be bear i say that be too long to wait tonight the american people know we have to change but they're also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the week and month ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the change happen in the right way they know that as soon as i leave this chamber and you go home various interest group will be out in force lobby against this or that piece of this plan and that the force of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reason why we good ought to do this but we just can't do it our people will be watch and wonder not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this be go to be business as usual or a real new day whether we're all go to conduct ourselves as if we know we're work for them we must scale the wall of the people's scepticisms not with our word but with our deed after so many year of gridlock and indecision after so many hopeful beginning and so few promise result the american people be go to be harsh in their judgment of all of us if we fail to seize this moment this economic plan can't please everybody if the package be pick apart there will be something that will anger each of us won't please anybody but if it be take as a whole it will help all of us so i ask you all to begin by resist the temptation to focus only on a particular spend cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't make and nobody like the tax increase but let's just face fact for year through administration of both party income have stall and debt have explode and productivity have not grow as it should we cannot deny the reality of our condition we have get to play the hand we be deal and play it as good we can my fellow american the test of this plan cannot be what be in it for me it have get to be what be in it for us if we work hard and if we work together if we rededicate ourselves to create job to reward work to strengthen our family to reinvent our government we can lift our country's fortune again tonight i ask everyone in this chamber and every american to look simply into your heart to spark your own hope to fire your own imagination there be so much good so much possibility so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly as leader should our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress this must be america's new direction let us summon the courage to seize it thank you god bless america thank you very much mr speaker mr president member of the 103d congress my fellow american i'm not at all sure what speech be in the teleprompter tonight but i hope we can talk about the state of the union i ask you to begin by recall the memory of the giant who preside over this chamber with such force and grace tip o'neill like to call himself a man of the house and he surely be that but even much he be a man of the people a bricklayer's son who help to build the great american middle class tip o'neill never forget who he be where he come from or who send him here tonight he's smile down on us for the first time from the lord's gallery but in his honor may we too always remember who we be where we come from and who send us here if we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity quality education and a fair shoot at the american dream they will do extraordinary thing we gather tonight in a world of change so profound and rapid that all nation be test our american heritage have always be to master such change to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad but for too long and in too many way that heritage be abandon and our country drift for year family life in america have be break down for year the wage of work people have be stagnant or decline for the year of trickle down economics we build a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadruple from to we experience the slow growth in a half century for too many family even when both parent be work the american dream have be slip away in the american people demand that we change a year ago i ask all of you to join me in accept responsibility for the future of our country good we do we replace drift and deadlock with renewal and reform and i want to thank every one of you here who hear the american people who break gridlock who give them the much successful teamwork between a president and a congress in year this congress produce a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollar cut spend and raise income tax on only the wealthy american this congress produce tax relief for million of low income worker to reward work over welfare it produce nafta it produce the brady bill now the brady law and thank you jim brady for be here and god bless you sir this congress produce tax cut to reduce the tax of out of small business who use the money to invest much and create much job it produce much research and treatment for aid much childhood immunization much support for women's health research much affordable college loan for the middle class a new national service program for that who want to give something back to their country and their community for high education a dramatic increase in high tech investment to move us from a defense to a domestic high tech economy this congress produce a new law the motor voter bill to help million of people register to vote it produce family and medical leave all pass all sign into law with not one single veto this accomplishment be all commitment i make when i seek this office and in fairness they all have to be pass by you in this congress but i be persuade that the real credit belong to the people who send us here who pay our salary who hold our foot to the fre but what we do here be really begin to change life let me just give you one example i will never forget what the family and medical leave law mean to just one father i meet early one sunday morning in the white house it be unusual to see a family there tour early sunday morning but he have his wife and his three child there one of them in a wheelchair i come up and after we have our picture take and have a little visit i be walk off and that man grab me by the arm and he say mr president let me tell you something my little girl here be desperately ill she's probably not go to make it but because of the family leave law i be able to take time off to spend with her the much important time i ever spend in my life without lose my job and hurt the rest of my family it mean much to me than i will ever be able to say don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a difference it do though we be make a difference our work have just begin many american still haven't feel the impact of what we've do the recovery still hasn't touch every community or create enough job income be still stagnant there's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many place abroad the young democracy we be strongly support still face very difficult time and look to us for leadership and so tonight let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal to create much and good job to guarantee health security for all to reward work over welfare to promote democracy abroad and to begin to reclaim our street from violent crime and drug and gang to renew our own american community last year we begin to put our house in order by tackle the budget deficit that be drive us toward bankruptcy we cut billion in spend include entitlement and over separate budget item we freeze domestic spend and use honest budget number lead by the vice president we launch a campaign to reinvent government we cut staff cut perk even trim the fleet of federal limousine after year of leader whose rhetoric attack bureaucracy but whose action expand it we will actually reduce it by people over the next year by the time we have finish the federal bureaucracy will be at its low point in year because the deficit be so large and because they benefit from tax cut in the s we do ask the wealthy american to pay much to reduce the deficit so on april the 15th the american people will discover the truth about what we do last year on tax only the top yes listen the top percent of american as i say all along will pay high income tax rate let me repeat only the wealthy percent of american will face high income tax rate and no one else will and that be the truth of course there be as there always be in politic naysayer who say this plan wouldn't work but they be wrong when i become president the expert predict that next year's deficit would be billion but because we act that same people now say the deficit be go to be under billion percent low than be previously predict our economic program have help to produce the low core inflation rate and the low interest rate in year and because that interest rate be down business investment and equipment be grow at time the rate of the previous year auto sale be way up home sale be at a record high million of american have refinance their home and our economy have produce million private sector job in much than be create in the previous year combine the people who support this economic plan should be proud of its early result proud but everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there be much to do next month i will send you one of the tough budget ever present to congress it will cut spend in much than program eliminate domestic program and reform the way in which government buy good and service this year we must again make the hard choice to live within the hard spend ceiling we have set we must do it we have prove we can bring the deficit down without choke off recovery without punish senior or the middle class and without putting our national security at risk if you will stick with this plan we will post consecutive year of decline deficit for the first time since harry truman live in the white house and once again the buck stop here our economic plan also bolster our strength and our credibility around the world once we reduce the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge the world echo with the sound of fall trade barrier in one year with nafta with gatt with our effort in asia and the national export strategy we do much to open world market to american product than at any time in the last two generation that mean much job and rise live standard for the american people low deficit low inflation low interest rate low trade barrier and high investment this be the build block of our recovery but if we want to take full advantage of the opportunity before us in the global economy you all know we must do much as we reduce defense spend i ask congress to invest much in the technology of tomorrow defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create job for our people here at home as we protect our environment we must invest in the environmental technology of the future which will create job this year we will fight for a revitalize clean water act and a safe drink water act and a reform superfund program and the vice president be right we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom every clinic every library every hospital in america into a national information super highway by the year think of it instant access to information will increase productivity will help to educate our child it will provide good medical care it will create job and i call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year as we expand opportunity and create job no one can be leave out we must continue to enforce fair lend and fair house and all civil right law because america will never be complete in its renewal until everyone share in its bounty but we all know too we can do all this thing put our economic house in order expand world trade target the job of the future guarantee equal opportunity but if we're honest we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education train and skill they need to seize the opportunity of tomorrow we must set tough world class academic and occupational standard for all our child and give our teacher and student the tool they need to meet them our goal proposal will empower individual school district to experiment with idea like charter their school to be run by private corporation or have much public school choice to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard be our child learn what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy goal link world class standard to grassroots reform and i hope congress will pass it without delay our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work provide at less one year of apprenticeship beyond high school after all much of the people we're count on to build our economic future won't graduate from college it's time to stop ignore them and start empower them we must literally transform our outdate unemployment system into a new reemployment system the old unemployment system just sort of keep you go while you wait for your old job to come back we've get to have a new system to move people into new and good job because much of that old job just don't come back and we know that the only way to have real job security in the future to get a good job with a grow income be to have real skill and the ability to learn new one so we've get to streamline today's patchwork of train program and make them a source of new skill for our people who lose their job reemployment not unemployment must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal i urge you to pass it in this session of congress and just as we must transform our unemployment system so must we also revolutionize our welfare system it doesn't work it defy our value as a nation if we value work we can't justify a system that make welfare much attractive than work if people be worry about lose their health care if we value responsibility we can't ignore the billion in child support absent parent ought to be pay to million of parent who be take care of their child if we value strong family we can't perpetuate a system that actually penalize that who stay together can you believe that a child who have a child get much money from the government for leave home than for stay home with a parent or a grandparent that's not just bad policy it's wrong and we ought to change it i work on this problem for year before i become president with other governor and with member of congress of both party and with the previous administration of another party i work on it with people who be on welfare lot of them and i want to say something to everybody here who care about this issue the people who much want to change this system be the people who be dependent on it they want to get off welfare they want to go back to work they want to do right by their kid i once have a hear when i be a governor and i bring in people on welfare from all over america who have find their way to work the woman from my state who testify be ask this question what's the good thing about be off welfare and in a job and without blink a eye she look at governor and she say when my boy go to school and they say what do you mother do for a live he can give a answer this people want a good system and we ought to give it to them last year we begin this we give the state much power to innovate because we know that a lot of great idea come from outside washington and many state be already use it then this congress take a dramatic step instead of tax people with modest income into poverty we help them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increase the earn income tax credit it will lift million work family out of poverty reward work over welfare make it possible for people to be successful worker and successful parent now that's real welfare reform but there be much to be do this spring i will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that build on the family support act of and restore the basic value of work and responsibility we'll say to teenager if you have a child out of wedlock we will no long give you a check to set up a separate household we want family to stay together say to absent parent who aren't pay their child support if you're not provide for your child we'll garnish your wage suspend your license track you across state line and if necessary make some of you work off what you owe people who bring child into this world cannot and must not walk away from them but to all that who depend on welfare we should offer ultimately a simple compact we'll provide the support the job train the child care you need for up to year but after that anyone who can work must in the private sector wherever possible in community service if necessary that's the only way we'll ever make elfare what it ought to be a 2 chance not a way of life i know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in at the same time we tackle health care but let me point out i think it be inevitable and imperative it be estimate that one million people be on welfare today because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their child that who choose to leave welfare for job without health benefit and many entry level job don't have health benefit find themselves in the incredible position of pay tax that help to pay for health care coverage for that who make the other choice to stay on welfare no wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage we've get to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform so this year we will make history by reform the health care system and i would say to you all of you my fellow public servant this be another issue where the people be way ahead of the politician that may not be popular with either party but it happen to be the truth you know the first lady have receive now almost a million letter from people all across america and from all walk of life i'd like to share just one of them with you richard anderson of reno nevada lose his job and with it his health insurance two week late his wife judy suffer a cerebral aneurysm he rush her to the hospital where she stay in intensive care for day the andersons bill be over although judy recover and richard go back to work at a hour the bill be too much for them and they be literally force into bankruptcy mrs clinton he write to hillary no one in the unite state of america should have to lose everything they've work for all their life because they be unfortunate enough to become ill it be to help the richard and judy andersons of america that the first lady and so many other have work so hard and so long on this health care reform issue we owe them our thank and our action i know there be people here who say there's no health care crisis tell it to richard and judy anderson tell it to the million american who have no coverage at all for some time each year tell it to the million american with that preexist condition that folk be pay much or they can't get insurance at all or they can't ever change their job because they or someone in their family have one of that preexist condition tell it to the small business burden by the skyrocket cost of insurance much small business cover their employee and they pay on average percent much in premium than big business or government or tell it to the percent of insure american three out of four whose policy have lifetime limit and that mean they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the much so if any of you believe there's no crisis you tell it to that people because i can't there be some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people's life and all you have to do be go out and listen to them just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country they're republican and democrat and independent it doesn't have a lick to do with party they think we don't get it and it's time we show them that we do get it from the day we begin our health care initiative have be design to strengthen what be good about our health care system the world's good health care professional cut edge research and wonderful research institution medicare for old american none of this none of it should be put at risk but we're pay much and much money for little and little care every year few and few american even get to choose their doctor every year doctor and nurse spend much time on paperwork and little time with patient because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system have become this system be riddle with inefficiency with abuse with fraud and everybody know it in today's health care system insurance company call the shot they pick whom they cover and how they cover them they can cut off your benefit when you need your coverage the much they be in charge what do it mean it mean every night million of good insure american go to bed just a illness a accident or a pink slip away from have no coverage or financial ruin it mean every morning million of american go to work without any health insurance at all something the worker in no other advance country in the world do it mean that every year much and much hard work people be tell to pick a new doctor because their boss have have to pick a new plan and countless other turn down good job because they know if they take the good job they will lose their health insurance if we just let the health care system continue to drift our country will have people with little care few choice and high bill now our approach protect the quality of care and people's choice it build on what work today in the private sector to expand employer base coverage to guarantee private insurance for every american and i may say employer base private insurance for every american be propose year ago by president richard nixon to the unite state congress it be a good idea then and it's a good idea today why do we want guarantee private insurance because right now out of people who have insurance get it through their employer and that should continue and if your employer be provide good benefit at reasonable price that should continue too that ought to make the congress and the president feel good our goal be health insurance everybody can depend on comprehensive benefit that cover preventive care and prescription drug health premium that don't just explode when you get sick or you get old the power no matter how small your business be to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rate government and big business get today one simple form for people who be sick and much of all the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor our approach protect old american every plan before the congress propose to slow the growth of medicare the difference be this we believe that saving should be use to improve health care for senior citizen medicare must be protect and it should cover prescription drug and we should take the first step in cover long term care to that who would cut medicare without protect senior i say the solution to today's squeeze on middle class work people's health care be not to put the squeeze on middle class retire people's health care we can do good than that when it's all say and do it's pretty simple to me insurance ought to mean what it use to mean you pay a fair price for security and when you get sick health care's always there no matter what along with the guarantee of health security we all have to admit too there must be much responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system people have to take their kid to get immunize we should all take advantage of preventive care we must all work together to stop the violence that explode our emergency room we have to practice good health habit and we can't abuse the system and that who don't have insurance under our approach will get coverage but they'll have to pay something for it too the minority of business that provide no insurance at all and in so do shift the cost of the care of their employee to other should contribute something people who smoke should pay much for a pack of cigarette everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis there can't be any much something for nothing it will not be easy but it can be do now in the come month i hope very much to work with both democrat and republican to reform a health care system by use the market to bring down cost and to achieve last health security but if you look at history we see that for year this country have try to reform health care president roosevelt try president truman try president nixon try president carter try every time the special interest be powerful enough to defeat them but not this time i know that face up to this interest will require courage it will raise critical question about the way we finance our campaign and how lobbyist yield their influence the work of change frankly will never get any easy until we limit the influence of good finance interest who profit from this current system so i also must now call on you to finish the job both house begin last year by pass tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year you know my fellow american this be really a test for all of us the american people provide that of us in government service with terrific health care benefit at reasonable cost we have health care that's always there i think we need to give every hard work tax pay american the same health care security they have already give to us i want to make this very clear i be open as i have say repeatedly to the good idea of concern member of both party i have no special brief for any specific approach even in our own bill except this if you send me legislation that do not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be take away you will force me to take this pen veto the legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over again but i don't think that's go to happen i think we're ready to act now i believe that you're ready to act now and if you're ready to guarantee every american the same health care that you have health care that can never be take away now not next year or the year after now be the time to stand with the people who send us here now as we take this step together to renew our strength at home we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad this be a promise moment because of the agreement we have reach this year last year russia's strategic nuclear missile soon will no long be point at the unite state nor will we point ours at them instead of build weapon in space russian scientist will help us to build the international space station of course there be still danger in the world rampant arm proliferation bitter regional conflict ethnic and nationalist tension in many new democracy severe environmental degradation the world over and fanatic who seek to cripple the world's city with terror as the world's great power we must therefore maintain our defense and our responsibility this year we secure indictment against terrorist and sanction against that who harbor them we work to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth we achieve agreement with ukraine with belarus with kazahkstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal we be work to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapon we will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapon worldwide and early today we join with over nation to begin negotiation on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear test but nothing nothing be much important to our security than our nation's arm force we honor their contribution include that who be carry out the long humanitarian air lift in history in bosnia that who will complete their mission in somalia this year and their brave comrade who give their life there our force be the fine military our nation have ever have and i have pledge that as long as i be president they will remain the good equip the good train and the good prepare fight force on the face of the earth last year i propose a defense plan that maintain our post cold war security at a low cost this year many people urge me to cut our defense spend far to pay for other government program i say no the budget i send to congress draw the line against far defense cut it protect the readiness and quality of our force ultimately the good strategy be to do that we must not cut defense far i hope the congress without regard to party will support that position ultimately the good strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace be to support the advance of democracy elsewhere democracy don't attack each other they make good trade partner and partner in diplomacy that be why we have support you and i the democratic reformer in russia and in the other state of the former soviet bloc i applaud the bipartisan support this congress provide last year for our initiative to help russia ukraine and the other state through their epic transformation our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and value we will continue to urge russia and the other state to press ahead with economic reform and we will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problem while insist that if russian troop operate in neighbor state they do so only when that state agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standard but we must also remember as this nation chart their own future and they must chart their own future how much much secure and much prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former communist bloc our policy have be to support that move and that have be the policy of the congress we should continue it that be why i go to europe early this month to work with our european partner to help to integrate all the former communist country into a europe that have a possibility of become unify for the first time in its entire history its entire history base on the simple commitment of all nation in europe to democracy to free market and to respect for exist border with our ally we have create a partnership for peace that invite state from the former soviet bloc and other non nato member to work with nato in military cooperation when i meet with central europe's leader include lech walesa and vбclav havel man who put their life on the line for freedom i tell them that the security of their region be important to our country's security this year we must also do much to support democratic renewal and human right and sustainable development all around the world we will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord we will continue stand by south africa as it work its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy we will convene a summit of the western hemisphere's democratic leader from canada to the tip of south america and we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti and as we build a much constructive relationship with china we must continue to insist on clear sign of improvement in that nation's human right record we will also work for new progress toward the middle east peace last year the world watch yitzhak rabin and yasser arafat at the white house when they have their historic handshake of reconciliation but there be a long hard road ahead and on that road i be determine that i and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and last peace for all the people of the region now there be some in our country who argue that with the cold war america should turn its back on the rest of the world many around the world be afraid we would do just that but i take this office on a pledge that have no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remain engage in the rest of the world and this year because of our work together enact nafta keep our military strong and prepare support democracy abroad we have reaffirm america's leadership america's engagement and as a result the american people be much secure than they be before but while american be much secure from threat abroad i think we all know that in many way we be little secure from threat here at home every day the national peace be shatter by crime in petaluma california a innocent slumber party give way to agonize tragedy for the family of polly klaas a ordinary train ride on long island end in a hail of millimeter round a tourist in florida be nearly burn alive by bigot simply because he be black right here in our nation's capital a brave young man name jason white a policeman the son and grandson of policeman be ruthlessly gun down violent crime and the fear it provoke be cripple our society limit personal freedom and fray the tie that bind us the crime bill before congress give you a chance to do something about it a chance to be tough and smart what do that mean let me begin by say i care a lot about this issue many year ago when i start out in public life i be the attorney general of my state i serve as a governor for a dozen year i know what it's like to sign law increase penalty to build much prison cell to carry out the death penalty i understand this issue and it be not a simple thing first we must recognize that much violent crime be commit by a small percentage of criminal who too often break the law even when they be on parole now that who commit crime should be punish and that who commit repeat violent crime should be tell when you commit a 3 violent crime you will be put away and put away for good three strike and you be out 2 we must take serious step to reduce violence and prevent crime begin with much police officer and much community police we know right now that police who work the street know the folk have the respect of the neighborhood kid focus on high crime area we know that they be much likely to prevent crime as good as catch criminal look at the experience of houston where the crime rate drop percent in one year when that approach be take here tonight be one of that community policeman a brave young detective kevin jett whose beat be eight square block in one of the tough neighborhood in new york every day he restore some sanity and safety and a sense of value and connection to the people whose life he protect i'd like to ask him to stand up and be recognize tonight thank you sir you will be give a chance to give the child of this country the law abide work people of this country and don't forget in the tough neighborhood in this country in the high crime neighborhood in this country the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law pay their tax do their good to raise their kid they deserve people like kevin jett and you're go to be give a chance to give the american people another of them good train and i urge you to do it you have before you crime legislation which also establish a police corp to encourage young people to get a education and pay it off by serve as police officer which encourage retire military personnel to move into police force a inordinate resource for our country one which have a safe school provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodge bullet this be important thing the 3 thing we have to do be to build on the brady bill the brady law to take far step to keep gun out of the hand of criminal i want to say something about this issue hunter must always be free to hunt law abide adult should always be free to own gun and protect their home i respect that part of our culture i grow up in it but i want to ask the sportsman and other who lawfully own gun to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence i say to you i know you didn't create this problem but we need your help to solve it there be no sport purpose on earth that should stop the unite state congress from banish assault weapon that out gun police and cut down child 4 we must remember that drug be a factor in a enormous percentage of crime recent study indicate sadly that drug use be on the rise again among our young people the crime bill contain all the crime bill contain much money for drug treatment for criminal addict and boot camp for youthful offender that include incentive to get off drug and to stay off drug our administration's budget with all its cut contain a large increase in fund for drug treatment and drug education you must pass them both we need them desperately my fellow american the problem of violence be a american problem it have no partisan or philosophical element therefore i urge you to find way as quickly as possible to set aside partisan difference and pass a strong smart tough crime bill but far i urge you to consider this as you demand tough penalty for that who choose violence let us also remember how we come to this sad point in our tough neighborhood on our mean street in our poor rural area we have see a stun and simultaneous breakdown of community family and work the heart and soul of civilize society this have create a vast vacuum which have be fill by violence and drug and gang so i ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime we must give people especially our young people something to say yes to many of our initiative from job train to welfare reform to health care to national service will help to rebuild distress community to strengthen family to provide work but much need to be do that's what our community empowerment agendum be all about challenge business to provide much investment through empowerment zone ensure bank will make loan in the same community their deposit come from pass legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development bank to create job opportunity and hope where they're need much i think you know that to really solve this problem we'll all have to put our head together leave our ideological armor aside and find some new idea to do even much and let's be honest we all know something else too our problem go way beyond the reach of government they're root in the loss of value in the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our family and our community my fellow american we can cut the deficit create job promote democracy around the world pass welfare reform and health care pass the tough crime bill in history but still leave too many of our people behind the american people have get to want to change from within if we're go to bring back work and family and community we cannot renew our country when within a decade much than half of the child will be bear into family where there have be no marriage we cannot renew this country when year old boy get semi automatic weapon to shoot year old for kick we can't renew our country when child be have child and the father walk away as if the kid don't amount to anything we can't renew the country when our business eagerly look for new investment and new customer abroad but ignore that people right here at home who would give anything to have their job and would gladly buy their product if they have the money to do it we can't renew our country unless much of usi mean all of us be will to join the church and the other good citizen people like all the minister i've work with over the year or the priest and the nun i meet at our lady of help in east los angeles or my good friend tony campollo in philadelphia unless we're will to work with people like that people who be save kid adopt school make street safe all of us can do that we can't renew our country until we realize that government don't raise child parent do parent who know their children's teacher and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kid right from wrong that kind of parent can make all the difference i know i have one i'm tell you we have get to stop point our finger at this kid who have no future and reach our hand out to them our country need it we need it and they deserve it so i say to you tonight let's give our child a future let us take away their gun and give them book let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope let us by our example teach them to obey the law respect our neighbor and cherish our value let us weave this sturdy thread into a new american community that can once much stand strong against the force of despair and evil because everybody have a chance to walk into a good tomorrow oh there will be naysayer who fear that we won't be equal to the challenge of this time but they misread our history our heritage even today's headline all that thing tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge when the earth shake and fire rage in california when i see the mississippi deluge the farmland of the midwest in a year flood when the century's bitter cold sweep from north dakota to newport news it seem as though the world itself be come apart at the seam but the american people they just come together they rise to the occasion neighbor help neighbor stranger risk life and limb to save total stranger show the good angel of our nature let us not reserve the good angel only for natural disaster leave our deep and much profound problem to petty political fight let us instead be true to our spirit face fact come together bring hope and move forward tonight my fellow american we be summon to answer a question as old as the republic itself what be the state of our union it be grow strong but it must be strong still with your help and god's help it will be thank you and god bless america mr president mr speaker member of the 104th congress my fellow american again we be here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again our democracy have speak so let me begin by congratulate all of you here in the 104th congress and congratulate you mr speaker if we agree on nothing else tonight we must agree that the american people certainly vote for change in and in and as i look out at you i know how some of you must have feel in i must say that in both year we didn't hear america sing we hear america shout and now all of us republican and democrat alike must say we hear you we will work together to earn the job you have give us for we be the keeper of a sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demand era over year ago our founder change the entire course of human history by join together to create a new country base on a single powerful idea we hold this truth to be self evident that all man be create equal endow by their creator with certain unalienable right and among this be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it have fall to every generation since then to preserve that idea the american idea and to deepen and expand its mean in new and different time to lincoln and to his congress to preserve the union and to end slavery to theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson to restrain the abuse and excess of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to franklin roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the great depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism and to all our president since to fight the cold war especially i recall two who struggle to fight that cold war in partnership with congress where the majority be of a different party to harry truman who summon us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who build the architecture of the cold war and to ronald reagan whom we wish good tonight and who exhort us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism be win in another time of change and challenge i have the honor to be the first president to be elect in the post cold war era a era mark by the global economy the information revolution unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the american people i come to this hallow chamber year ago on a mission to restore the american dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strong force for freedom and democracy in the entire world i be determine then to tackle the tough problem too long ignore in this effort i be frank to say that i have make my mistake and i have learn again the importance of humility in all human endeavor but i be also proud to say tonight that our country be strong than it be year ago thank you record number of american be succeed in the new global economy we be at peace and we be a force for peace and freedom throughout the world we have almost million new job since i become president and we have the low combine rate of unemployment and inflation in year our business be much productive and here we have work to bring the deficit down to expand trade to put much police on our street to give our citizen much of the tool they need to get a education and to rebuild their own community but the rise tide be not lift all boat while our nation be enjoy peace and prosperity too many of our people be still work hard and hard for little and little while our business be restructure and grow much productive and competitive too many of our people still can't be sure of have a job next year or even next month and far much than our material rich be threaten thing far much precious to us our child our family our value our civil life be suffer in america today citizen be work together little and shout at each other much the common bond of community which have be the great strength of our country from its very begin be badly fray what be we to do about it much than year ago at the dawn of another new era president roosevelt tell our nation new condition impose new requirement on government and that who conduct government and from that simple proposition he shape the new deal which help to restore our nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their government for half a century that approach work in its time but we today we face a very different time and very different condition we be move from a industrial age build on gear and sweat to a information age demand skill and learn and flexibility our government once a champion of national purpose be now see by many as simply a captive of narrow interest putting much burden on our citizen rather than equip them to get ahead the value that use to hold us all together seem to be come apart so tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenge of this time as we enter a new era we need a new set of understanding not just with government but even much important with one another as american that's what i want to talk with you about tonight i call it the new covenant but it's ground in a very very old idea that all american have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their god give talent and determination can take them and to give something back to their community and their country in return opportunity and responsibility they go hand in hand we can't have one without the other and our national community can't hold together without both our new covenant be a new set of understanding for how we can equip our people to meet the challenge of a new economy how we can change the way our government work to fit a different time and above all how we can repair the damage bond in our society and come together behind our common purpose we must have dramatic change in our economy our government and ourselves my fellow american without regard to party let us rise to the occasion let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride as we embark on this new course let us put our country first remember that regardless of party label we be all american and let the final test of everything we do be a simple one be it good for the american people let me begin by say that we cannot ask american to be good citizen if we be not good servant you make a good start by pass that law which apply to congress all the law you put on the private sector and i be proud to sign it yesterday but we have a lot much to do before people really trust the way thing work around here three time as many lobbyist be in the street and corridor of washington as be here year ago the american people look at their capital and they see a city where the good connect and the good protect can work the system but the interest of ordinary citizen be often leave out as the new congress open its door lobbyist be still do business as usual the gift the trip all the thing that people be concern about haven't stop twice this month you miss opportunity to stop this practice i know there be other consideration in that vote but i want to use something that i've hear my republican friend say from time to time there doesn't have to be a law for everything so tonight i ask you to just stop take the lobbyist perk just stop we don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the american people that thing be really change but i also hope you will send me the strong possible lobby reform bill and i'll sign that too we should require lobbyist to tell the people for whom they work what they're spend what they want we should also curb the role of big money in election by cap the cost of campaign and limit the influence of pac's and as i have say for year we should work to open the airwave so that they can be a instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by give free tv time to candidate for public office when the last congress kill political reform last year it be report in the press that the lobbyist actually stand in the hall of this sacred build and cheer this year let's give the folk at home something to cheer about much important i think we all agree that we have to change the way the government work let's make it small little costly and smart lean not mean i just tell the speaker the equal time doctrine be alive and good the new covenant approach to govern be as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer be from the manual typewriter the old way of govern around here protect organize interest we should look out for the interest of ordinary people the old way divide us by interest constituency or class the new covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's good for our country the old way dispense service through large top down inflexible bureaucracy the new covenant way should shift this resource and decisionmaking from bureaucrat to citizen inject choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy the old way of govern around here actually seem to reward failure the new covenant way should have build in incentive to reward success the old way be centralize here in washington the new covenant way must take hold in the community all across america and we should help them to do that our job here be to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to make the much of their own life and to enhance our security here at home and abroad we must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves we should rely on government as a partner to help us to do much for ourselves and for each other i hope very much that as we debate this specific and excite matter we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there be somehow a program for every problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the government be a source of every problem we have our job be to get rid of yesterday's government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's need and we ought to do it together you know for year before i become president i hear other say they would cut government and how bad it be but not much happen we actually do it we cut over a quarter of a trillion dollar in spend much than domestic program much than position from the federal bureaucracy in the last year alone base on decision already make we will have cut a total of much than a quarter of a million position from the federal government make it the small it have be since john kennedy be president by the time i come here again next year under the leadership of vice president gore our initiative have already save taxpayer billion the age of the hammer and the ashtray you can break on david letterman be go deadwood program like mohair subsidy be go we've streamline the agriculture department by reduce it by much than office we've slash the small business loan form from a inch thick to a single page we've throw away the government's page personnel manual and the government be work good in important way fema the federal emergency management agency have go from be a disaster to help people in disaster you can ask the farmer in the middle west who fight the flood there or the people in california who have deal with flood and earthquake and fire and they'll tell you that government worker work hand in hand with private business rebuild southern california's fracture freeway in record time and under budget and because the federal government move fast all but one of the school damage in the earthquake be back in business now there be a lot of other thing that i can talk about i want to just mention one because it will be discuss here in the next few week university administrator all over the country have tell me that they be save week and week of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program which make college loan cheap and much affordable with good repayment term for student cost the government little and cut out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the university we shouldn't cap that program we should give every college in america the opportunity to be a part of it previous government program gather dust the reinvent government report be get result and we're not through there's go to be a 2 round of reinvent government we propose to cut billion in spend by shrink department extend our freeze on domestic spend cut public house program down to get rid of over program we do not need like the interstate commerce commission and the helium reserve program and we're work on get rid of unnecessary regulation and make them much sensible the program and regulation that have outlive their usefulness should go we have to cut yesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problem and we need to get government close to the people it's mean to serve we need to help move program down to the point where state and community and private citizen in the private sector can do a good job if they can do it we ought to let them do it we should get out of the way and let them do what they can do good take power away from federal bureaucracy and give it back to community and individual be something everyone should be able to be for it's time for congress to stop pass on to the state the cost of decision we make here in washington i know there be still serious difference over the detail of the unfunded mandate legislation but i want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justify relief where we need to give it for year congress conceal in the budget score of pet spend project last year be no difference there be a million to study stress in plant and million for a tick removal program that didn't work it's hard to remove tick that of us who have have them know but i'll tell you something if you'll give me line item veto i'll remove some of that unnecessary spend but i think we should all remember and almost all of us would agree that government still have important responsibility our young people we should think of this when we cut our young people hold our future in their hand we still owe a debt to our veteran and our senior citizen have make us what we be now my budget cut a lot but it protect education veteran social security and medicare and i hope you will do the same thing you should and i hope you will and when we give much flexibility to the state let us remember that there be certain fundamental national need that should be address in every state north and south east and west immunization against childhood disease school lunch in all our school head start medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infant medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infant all this thing all this thing be in the national interest i applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulation but when we deregulate let's remember what national action in the national interest have give us safe food for our family safe toy for our child safe nurse home for our parent safe car and highway and safe workplace clean air and clean water do we need common sense and fairness in our regulation you bet we do but we can have common sense and still provide for safe drink water we can have fairness and still clean up toxic dump and we ought to do it should we cut the deficit much good of course we should of course we should but we can bring it down in a way that still protect our economic recovery and do not unduly punish people who should not be punish but instead should be help i know many of you in this chamber support the balance budget amendment i certainly want to balance the budget our administration have do much to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time if you believe pass this amendment be the right thing to do then you have to be straight with the american people they have a right to know what you're go to cut what tax you're go to raise and how it's go to affect them we should be do thing in the open around here for example everybody ought to know if this proposal be go to endanger social security i would oppose that and i think much american would nothing have do much to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our fail welfare system this be one of the problem we have to face here in washington in our new covenant it reward welfare over work it undermine family value it let million of parent get away without pay their child support it keep a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trap on it for a very long time i've work on this problem for a long time nearly year now as a governor i have the honor of work with the reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in in the last year we make a good start at continue the work of welfare reform our administration give two dozen state the right to slash through federal rule and regulation to reform their own welfare system and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency last year i introduce the much sweep welfare reform plan ever present by a administration we have to make welfare what it be mean to be a 2 chance not a way of life we have to help that on welfare move to work as quickly as possible to provide child care and teach them skill if that's what they need for up to year and after that there ought to be a simple hard rule anyone who can work must go to work if a parent isn't pay child support they should be force to pay we should suspend driver license track them across state line make them work off what they owe that be what we should do government do not raise child people do and the parent must take responsibility for the child they bring into this world i want to work with you with all of you to pass welfare reform but our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence from welfare to work from mere childbearing to responsible parenting our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor we should we should require work and mutual responsibility but we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor they're young or even because they're unmarried we should promote responsibility by require young mother to live at home with their parent or in other supervise setting by require them to finish school but we shouldn't put them and their child out on the street and i know all the argument pro and con and i have read and think about this for a long time i still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor child for the mistake of their parent my fellow american every single survey show that all the american people care about this without regard to party or race or region so let this be the year we end welfare as we know it but also let this be the year that we be all able to stop use this issue to divide america no one be much eager to end welfare i may be the only president who have actually have the opportunity to sit in a welfare office who's actually spend hour and hour talk to people on welfare and i be tell you the people who be trap on it know it doesn't work they also want to get off so we can promote together education and work and good parenting i have no problem with punish bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent i just don't want to punish poverty and past mistake all of us have make our mistake and none of us can change our yesterday but every one of us can change our tomorrow and america's good example of that may be lynn woolsey who work her way off welfare to become a congresswoman from the state of california i know the member of this congress be concern about crime as be all the citizen of our country and i remind you that last year we pass a very tough crime bill long sentence three strike and you're out almost new capital punishment offense much prison much prevention much police and we pay for it all by reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy and give the money back to local community to low the crime rate there may be other thing we can do to be tough on crime to be smart with crime to help to low that rate first good if there be let's talk about them and let's do them but let's not go back on the thing that we do last year that we know work that we know work because the local law enforcement officer tell us that we do the right thing because local community leader who have work for year and year to low the crime rate tell us that they work let's look at the experience of our city and our rural area where the crime rate have go down and ask the people who do it how they do it and if what we do last year support the decline in the crime rate and i be convince that it do let us not go back on it let's stick with it implement it we've get much hard year of work to do to do that i don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight but i have to mention one issue that divide this body greatly last year the last congress also pass the brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on assault weapon i don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several member of the last congress who vote for that aren't here tonight because they vote for it and i know therefore that some of you who be here because they vote for it be under enormous pressure to repeal it i just have to tell you how i feel about it the member of congress who vote for that bill and i would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arm to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sport activity i've do it since i be a boy and i'm go to keep right on do it until i can't do it anymore but a lot of people lay down their seat in congress so that police officer and kid wouldn't have to lie down their life under a hail of assault weapon attack and i will not let that be repeal i will not let it be repeal i'd like to talk about a couple of other issue we have to deal with i want us to cut much spend but i hope we won't cut government program that help to prepare us for the new economy promote responsibility and be organize from the grassroots up not by federal bureaucracy the very good example of this be the national service corp americorps it pass with strong bipartisan support and now there be american much than ever serve in one year in the peace corp work all over this country help people person to person in local grassroots volunteer group solve problem and in the process earn some money for their education this be citizenship at its good it's good for the americorps member but it's good for the rest of us too it's the essence of the new covenant and we shouldn't stop it all american not only in the state much heavily affect but in every place in this country be rightly disturb by the large number of illegal alien enter our country the job they hold may otherwise be hold by citizen or legal immigrant the public service they use impose burden on our taxpayer that's why our administration have move aggressively to secure our border much by hire a record numb of new border guard by deport twice as many criminal alien as ever before by crack down on illegal hire by bar welfare benefit to illegal alien in the budget i will present to you we will try to do much to speed the deportation of illegal alien who be arrest for crime to good identify illegal alien in the workplace as recommend by the commission head by former congresswoman barbara jordan we be a nation of immigrant but we be also a nation of law it be wrong and ultimately self defeat for a nation of immigrant to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration law we have see in recent year and we must do much to stop it the much important job of our government in this new era be to empower the american people to succeed in the global economy america have always be a land of opportunity a land where if you work hard you can get ahead we've become a great middle class country middle class value sustain us we must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do everything we can to support the million of american who be already successful in the new economy america be once again the world's strong economic power almost million new job in the last year export boom inflation down high wage job be come back a record numb of american entrepreneur be live the american dream if we want it to stay that way that who work and lift our nation must have much of its benefit today too many of that people be be leave out they're work hard for little they have little security little income little certainty that they can even afford a vacation much little college for their kid or retirement for themselves we cannot let this continue if we don't act our economy will probably keep do what it's be do since about when the income growth begin to go to that at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle get very little growth and people who work like crazy but be on the bottom then fall even far and far behind in the year afterward no matter how hard they work we've get to have a government that can be a real partner in make this new economy work for all of our people a government that help each and every one of us to get a education and to have the opportunity to renew our skill that's why we work so hard to increase educational opportunity in the last year from head start to public school to apprenticeship for young people who don't go to college to make college loan much available and much affordable that's the first thing we have to do we've get to do something to empower people to improve their skill the 2 thing we ought to do be to help people raise their income immediately by lower their tax we take the first step in with a work family tax cut for million family with income under a tax cut that this year will average about a family and we also give tax reduction to much small and new business before we can do much than that we first have to bring down the deficit we inherit and we have to get economic growth up now we've do both and now we can cut tax in a much comprehensive way but tax cut should reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizen through education and train to make the much of their own life the spotlight should shine on that who make the right choice for themselves their family and their community i have propose the middle class bill of right which should properly be call the bill of right and responsibility because its provision only benefit that who be work to educate and raise their child and to educate themselves it will therefore give need tax relief and raise income in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefit all of us there be four provision first a tax deduction for all education and train after high school if you think about it we permit business to deduct their investment we permit individual to deduct interest on their home mortgage but today a education be even much important to the economic good be of our whole country than even that thing be we should do everything we can to encourage it and i hope you will support it 2 we ought to cut tax for family with child under 3 we ought to foster much saving and personal responsibility by permit people to establish a individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education health care first time homebuying or the care of a parent and 4 we should pass a gi bill for america's worker we propose to collapse nearly federal program and not give the money to the state but give the money directly to the american people offer voucher to them so that they if they're lay off or if they're work for a very low wage can get a voucher worth a year for up to year to go to their local community college or wherever else they want to get the skill they need to improve their life let's empower people in this way move it from the government directly to the worker of america now any one of us can call for a tax cut but i won't accept one that explode the deficit or put our recovery at risk we ought to pay for our tax cut fully and honestly just year ago it be a open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit thank to the courage of the people who be here then many of whom didn't return we do cut the deficit we begin to do what other say would not be do we cut the deficit by over billion about for every family in this country it's come down year in a row for the first time since mr truman be president and i don't think anybody in america want us to let it explode again in the budget i will send you the middle class bill of right be fully pay for by budget cut in bureaucracy cut in program cut in special interest subsidy and the spend cut will much than double the tax cut my budget pay for the middle class bill of right without any cut in medicare and i will oppose any attempt to pay for tax cut with medicare cut that's not the right thing to do i know that a lot of you have your own idea about tax relief and some of them i find quite interest i really want to work with all of you my test for our proposal will be will it create job and raise income will it strengthen our family and support our child be it pay for will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass if it do i'll support it but if it doesn't i won't the goal of build the middle class and shrink the underclass be also why i believe that you should raise the minimum wage it reward work two and a half million american two and a half million american often woman with child be work out there today for a hour in term of real buy power by next year that minimum wage will be at a year low that's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work now i've study the argument and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase i believe the weight of the evidence be that a modest increase do not cost job and may even lure people back into the job market but the much important thing be you can't make a live on a hour especially if you have child even with the work family tax cut we pass last year in the past the minimum wage have be a bipartisan issue and i think it should be again so i want to challenge you to have honest hearing on this to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a live wage member of congress have be here little than a month but by the end of the week day into the new year every member of congress will have earn as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker make all year long everybody else here include the president have something else that too many american do without and that's health care now last year we almost come to blow over health care but we didn't do anything and the cold hard fact be that since last year since i be here another million american in work family have lose their health care and the cold hard fact be that many million much much of them farmer and small business people and self employ people have see their premium skyrocket their copays and deductible go up there's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistic have health insurance but really what they've get be a piece of paper that say they won't lose their home if they get sick now i still believe our country have get to move toward provide health security for every american family but i know that last year as the evidence indicate we bite off much than we can chew so i'm ask you that we work together let's do it step by step let's do whatever we have to do to get something do let's at less pass meaningful insurance reform so that no american risk lose coverage for face skyrocket price that nobody lose their coverage because they face high price or unavailable insurance when they change job or lose a job or a family member get sick i want to work together with all of you who have a interest in this with the democrat who work on it last time with the republican leader like senator dole who have a longtime commitment to health care reform and make some constructive proposal in this area last year we ought to make sure that self employ people in small business can buy insurance at much affordable rate through voluntary purchase pool we ought to help family provide long term care for a sick parent or a disable child we can work to help worker who lose their job at less keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work and we can find a way it may take some time but we can find a way to make sure that our child have health care you know i think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of the fact that our country be rate as have the world's much productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade but we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that have a small percentage of the work force and their child with health insurance today than we do year ago the last time we be the much productive economy in the world so let's work together on this it be too important for politic as usual much of what the american people be think about tonight be what we've already talk about a lot of people think that the security concern of america today be entirely internal to our border they relate to the security of our job and our home and our income and our child our street our health and protect that border now that the cold war have pass it's tempt to believe that all the security issue with the possible exception of trade reside here at home but it's not so our security still depend upon our continue world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy we still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad the financial crisis in mexico be a case in point i know it's not popular to say it tonight but we have to act not for the mexican people but for the sake of the million of american whose livelihood be tie to mexico's good be if we want to secure american job preserve american export safeguard america's border then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put mexico back on track now let me repeat it's not a loan it's not foreign aid it's not a bailout we will be give a guarantee like cosigning a note with good collateral that will cover our risk this legislation be the right thing for america that's why the bipartisan leadership have support it and i hope you in congress will pass it quickly it be in our interest and we can explain it to the american people because we're go to do it in the right way you know tonight this be the first state of the union address ever deliver since the begin of the cold war when not a single russian missile be point at the child of america and along with the russian we're on our way to destroy the missile and the bomber that carry nuclear warhead we've come so far so fast in this post cold war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for grant but it's still there and we aren't finish yet this year i'll ask the senate to approve start ii to eliminate weapon that carry much warhead the unite state will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the nuclear non proliferation treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban and to eliminate chemical weapon to stop and roll back north korea's potentially deadly nuclear program we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reach with that nation it's smart it's tough it's a deal base on continue inspection with safeguard for our ally and ourselves this year i'll submit to congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combat terrorist whether they strike at home or abroad as the coward who bomb the world trade center find out this country will hunt down terrorist and bring them to justice just this week another horrendous terrorist act in israel kill and injure score much on behalf of the american people and all of you i send our deep sympathy to the family of the victim i know that in the face of such evil it be hard for the people in the middle east to go forward but the terrorist represent the past not the future we must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between israel and all her neighbor in the middle east accordingly last night i sign a executive order that will block the asset in the unite state of terrorist organization that threaten to disrupt the peace process it prohibit financial transaction with this group and tonight i call on all our ally and peace love nation throughout the world to join us with renew fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism we cannot permit the future to be mar by terror and fear and paralysis from the day i take the oath of office i pledge that our nation would maintain the good equip good train and good prepare military on earth we have and they be they have manage the dramatic downsize of our force after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit but to make sure our military be ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their family deserve i'm ask the congress to add billion in defense spend over the next year i have visit many base at home and around the world since i become president tonight i repeat that request with renew conviction we ask a very great deal of our arm force now that they be small in numb we ask much of them they go out much often to much different place and stay long they be call to service in many many way and we must give them and their family what the time demand and what they have earn just think about what our troop have do in the last year show america at its good help to save hundred of thousand of people in rwanda move with lightning speed to head off another threat to kuwait give freedom and democracy back to the people of haiti we have proudly support peace and prosperity and freedom from south africa to northern ireland from central and eastern europe to asia from latin america to the middle east all this endeavor be good in that place but they make our future much confident and much secure good my fellow american that's my agendum for america's future expand opportunity not bureaucracy enhance security at home and abroad empower our people to make the much of their own life it's ambitious and achievable but it's not enough we even need much than new idea for change the world or equip american to compete in the new economy much than a government that's small smart and wise much than all of the change we can make in government and in the private sector from the outside in our fortune and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some question from within from the value and voice that speak to our heart as good as our head voice that tell us we have to do much to accept responsibility for ourselves and our family for our community and yes for our fellow citizen we see our family and our community all over this country come apart and we feel the common grind shift from under us the pta the town hall meet the ball park it's hard for a lot of overwork parent to find the time and space for that thing that strengthen the bond of trust and cooperation too many of our child don't even have parent and grandparent who can give them that experience that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity we all know what while we here in this chamber can make a difference on that thing that the real difference will be make by our fellow citizen where they work and where they live and that it will be make almost without regard to party when i use to go to the softball park in little rock to watch my daughter's league and people would come up to me father and mother and talk to me i can honestly say i have no idea whether percent of them be republican or democrat when i visit the relief center after the flood in california northern california last week a woman come up to me and do something that very few of you would do she hug me and say mr president i'm a republican but i'm glad you're here now why we can't wait for disaster to act the way we use to act every day because as we move into this next century everybody matter we don't have a person to waste and a lot of people be lose a lot of chance to do good that mean that we need a new covenant for everybody for our corporate and business leader we're go to work here to keep bring the deficit down to expand market to support their success in every possible way but they have a obligation when they're do good to keep job in our community and give their worker a fair share of the prosperity they generate for people in the entertainment industry in this country we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of expression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that come from the incessant repetitive mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeate our medium all the time we've get to ask our community leader and all kind of organization to help us stop our much serious social problem the epidemic of teen pregnancy and birth where there be no marriage i have send to congress a plan to target school all over this country with antipregnancy program that work but government can only do so much tonight i call on parent and leader all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference we can do this and we must and i would like to say a special word to our religious leader you know i'm proud of the fact the unite state have much house of worship per caput than any country in the world this people who lead our house of worship can ignite their congregation to carry their faith into action can reach out to all of our child to all of the people in distress to that who have be savage by the breakdown of all we hold dear because so much of what must be do must come from the inside out and our religious leader and their congregation can make all the difference they have a role in the new covenant as good there must be much responsibility for all of our citizen you know it take a lot of people to help all the kid in trouble stay off the street and in school it take a lot of people to build the habitat for humanity house that the speaker celebrate on his lapel pin it take a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organization in this country that make our community mean so much to much of us when we be kid it take every parent to teach the child the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong thing but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be i know it's hard when you're work hard for little when you're under great stress to do this thing a lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship much of us in politic haven't help very much for year we've mostly treat citizen like they be consumer or spectator sort of political couch potato who be suppose to watch the tv ad either promise them something for nothing or play on their fear and frustration and much and much of our citizen now get much of their information in very negative and aggressive way that be hardly conducive to honest and open conversation but the truth be we have get to stop see each other as enemy just because we have different view if you go back to the begin of this country the great strength of america as de tocqueville point out when he come here a long time ago have always be our ability to associate with people who be different from ourselves and to work together to find common grind and in this day everybody have a responsibility to do much of that we simply cannot want for a tornado a fire or a flood to behave like american ought to behave in deal with one another i want to finish up here by point out some folk that be up with the first lady that represent what i'm try to talk about citizen i have no idea what their party affiliation be or who they vote for in the last election but they represent what we ought to be do cindy perry teach 2 grader to read in americorps in rural kentucky she gain when she give she's a mother of four she say that her service inspire her to get her high school equivalency last year she be marry when she be a teenager stand up cindy she be marry when she be a teenager she have four child but she have time to serve other people to get her high school equivalency and she's go to use her americorps money to go back to college chief stephen bishop be the police chief of kansas city he's be a national leader stand up steve he's be a national leader in use much police in community police and he's work with americorps to do it and the crime rate in kansas city have go down as a result of what he do corporal gregory depestre go to haiti as part of his adopt country's force to help secure democracy in his native land and i may add we must be the only country in the world that can have go to haiti and take haitian american there who can speak the language and talk to the people and he be one of them and we're proud of him the next two folk i've have the honor of meet and get to know a little bite the reverend john and the reverend diana cherry of the ame zion church in temple hill maryland i'd like to ask them to stand i want to tell you about them in the early eighty they leave government service and form a church in a small live room in a small house in the early eighty today that church have member it be one of the three or four big church in the entire unite state it grow by a month they do it together and the special focus of their ministry be keep family together two thing they do make a big impression on me i visit their church once and i learn they be build a new sanctuary close to the washington dc line in a high crime high drug rate area because they think it be part of their ministry to change the life of the people who need them the 2 thing i want to say be that once reverend cherry be at a meet at the white house with some other religious leader and he leave early to go back to this church to minister to couple that he have bring back to his church from all over america to convince them to come back together to save their marriage and to raise their kid this be the kind of work that citizen be do in america we need much of it and it ought to be lift up and support the last person i want to introduce be jack lucas from hattiesburg mississippi jack would you stand up fifty year ago in the sand of iwo jima jack lucas teach and learn the lesson of citizenship on february 20th he and three of his buddy encounter the enemy and two grenade at their foot jack lucas throw himself on both of them in that moment he save

yesterday here's what he say about that day it didn't matter where you be from or who you be you rely on one another you do it for your country we all gain when we give and we reap what we sow that's at the heart of this new covenant responsibility opportunity and citizenship much than stale chapter in some remote civic book they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our god give potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country the endure dream from that first and much sacred covenant i believe every person in this country still believe that we be create equal and give by our creator the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this be a very very great country and our good day be still to come thank you and god bless you all thank you very much mr speaker mr vice president member of the 104th congress distinguish guest my fellow american all across our land let me begin tonight by say to our man and woman in uniform around the world and especially that help peace take root in bosnia and to their family i thank you america be very very proud of you my duty tonight be to report on the state of the union not the state of our government but of our american community and to set forth our responsibility in the word of our founder to form a much perfect union the state of the union be strong our economy be the healthy it have be in three decade we have the low combine rate of unemployment and inflation in year we have complete create nearly million new job over a million of them in basic industry like construction and automobile america be sell much car than japan for the first time since the s and for year in a row we have have a record numb of new business start in our country our leadership in the world be also strong bring hope for new peace and perhaps much important we be gain grind in restore our fundamental value the crime rate the welfare and food stamp roll the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate be all down and as they go down prospect for america's future go up we live in a age of possibility a hundred year ago we move from farm to factory now we move to a age of technology information and global competition this change have open vast new opportunity for our people but they have also present them with stiff challenge while much american be live good too many of our fellow citizen be work hard just to keep up and they be rightly concern about the security of their family we must answer here three fundamental question first how do we make the american dream of opportunity for all a reality for all american who be will to work for it 2 how do we preserve our old and endure value as we move into the future and 3 how do we meet this challenge together as one america we know big government do not have all the answer we know there's not a program for every problem we know and we have work to give the american people a small little bureaucratic government in washington and we have to give the american people one that life within its mean the era of big government be over but we cannot go back to the time when our citizen be leave to fend for

this country to love and care for their child if your family have separate you must pay your child support we're do much than ever to make sure you do and we're go to do much but let's all admit something about that too a check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance and only you only you can make the decision to help raise your child no matter who you be how low or high your station in life it be the much basic human duty of every american to do that job to the good of his or her ability our 2 challenge be to provide american with the educational opportunity we'll all

turn off the tv see that the homework be do and visit your children's classroom no program no teacher no one else can do that for you my fellow american high education be much important today than ever before we've create a new student loan program that's make it easy to borrow and repay that loan and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate that's something we should all be proud of because it be unconscionably high just a few year ago through americorps our national service program this year young people will earn college money by serve their local community to improve the life of their friend and neighbor this initiative be right for america and we should keep them go and we should also work hard to open the door of college even wide i challenge congress to expand work study and help one million young american work their way through college by the year to provide a merit scholarship for the top percent of graduate in every high school in the unite state to expand pell grant scholarship for deserve and needy student and to make up to a year of college tuition tax deductible it's a good idea for america our 3 challenge be to help every american who be will to

family raise child they need retirement security they need access to health care much and much american be find that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime so i challenge congress to consolidate overlap antiquated job train program into a simple voucher worth for unemployed or underemployed worker to use as they please for community college tuition or other train this be a gi bill for america's worker we should all be able to agree on much and much american be work hard without a raise congress set the minimum wage within a year the minimum wage will fall to a year

tax of million hard press work family to make sure that no parent who work full time would have to raise their child in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work this expand earn income tax credit be now worth about a year to a family of four live on the budget bill i veto would have reverse this achievement and raise tax on nearly million of this people we should not do that we should not do that i also agree that the people who be help under this initiative be not all that in our country who be work hard to do a good job raise their child and at work i agree that we need a tax credit for work family with child that's one of the thing much of us in this chamber i hope can agree on i know it be strongly support by the republican majority and it should be part of any final budget agreement i want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pension for your employee and i challenge congress to pass a proposal recommend by the white house conference on small business that would make it easy for small business and farmer to establish their own pension plan that be something we should all agree on we should also protect exist pension plan two year ago with bipartisan support that be almost unanimous on both side of the aisle we move to protect the pension of million work people and to stabilize the pension of million much congress should not now let company endanger that worker pension fund i know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employer to take money out of pension fund for other purpose would raise money for the treasury but i believe it be false economy i veto that proposal last year and i would have to do so again finally if our work family be go to succeed in the new economy they must be able to buy health insurance policy that they do not lose when they change job or when someone in their family get sick over the past year over one million american in work family have lose their health insurance we have to do much to make health care available to every american and congress should start by pass the bipartisan bill sponsor by senator kennedy and senator kassebaum that would require insurance company to stop drop people when they switch job and stop deny coverage for preexist condition let's all do that and even as we enact saving in this program we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protection of medicare and medicaid not just to the poor but to people in work family include child people with disability people with aid senior citizen in nurse home in the past year we've save billion just by fight health care fraud and abuse we have all agree to save much much we have all agree to stabilize the medicare trust fund but we must not abandon our fundamental

protection access to health care preservation of medicare and medicaid this thing along with the family and medical leave act pass in this thing will help responsible hard work american family to make the much of their own life but employer and employee must do their part as good as they be do in so many of our fine company work together putting the long term prosperity ahead of the short term gain as worker increase their hour and their productivity employer should make sure they get the skill they need and share the benefit of the good year as good as the burden of the bad one when company and worker work as a team they do good and so do america our 4 great challenge be to take our street back from crime and gang and drug at last we have begin to find a way to reduce crime form community

action by this congress action by our state by our people to prepare america for the 21st century action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and work for all our people action to strengthen education and harness the force of technology and science action to build strong family and strong community and a safe environment action to keep america the world's strong force for peace freedom and prosperity and above all action to build a much perfect union here at home the spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference we must be commit to the pursuit of opportunity for all american responsibility from all american in a community of all american and we must be commit to a new kind of government not to solve all our problem for us but to give our people all our people the tool they need to make the much of their own life and we must work together the people of this nation elect us all they want us to be partner not partisan they put us all right here in the same boat they give us all oar and they tell us to row now here be the direction i believe we should take first we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country to balance the budget renew our democracy and finish the job of welfare reform over the last year we have bring new economic growth by invest in our people expand our export cut our deficit create over million new job a year record now we must keep our economy the strong in the world we here tonight have a historic opportunity let this congress be the congress that finally balance the budget thank you in day i will propose a detail plan to balance the budget by this plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protect medicare medicaid education and the environment it will balance the budget and build on the vice president's effort to make our government work good even as it cost little it will balance the budget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and health care to help to raise a child to buy and sell a home balance the budget require only your vote and my signature it do not require us to rewrite our constitution i believe it be both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balance budget amendment that can cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted result such as judge halt social security check or increase tax let us at less agree we should not pass any measure no measure should be pass that threaten social security whatever your view on that we all must concede we don't need a constitutional amendment we need action whatever our difference we should balance the budget now and then for the long term health of our society we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve social security and reform medicare for the long run so that this fundamental program will be as strong for our child as they be for our parent and let me say something that's not in my script tonight i know this be not go to be easy but i really believe one of the reason the american people give me a 2 term be to take the tough decision in the next year that will carry our country through the next year i know it be easy for me than for you to say or do but another reason i be elect be to support all of you without regard to party to give you what be necessary to join in this decision we owe it to our country and to our future our 2 piece of unfinished business require us to commit ourselves tonight before the eye of america to finally enact bipartisan campaign finance reform now senator mccain and feingold representative shays and meehan have reach across party line here to craft tough and fair reform their proposal would curb spend reduce the role of special interest create a level play field between challenger and incumbent and ban contribution from noncitizen all corporate source and the other large soft money contribution that both party receive you know and i know that this can be delay and you know and i know the delay will mean the death of reform so let's set our own deadline let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass mccain feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy july the 4 there be a 3 piece of unfinished business over the last year we move a record 2ј million people off the welfare roll then last year congress enact landmark welfare reform

conscience unless you be prepare to finish the job and we must join together to do something else too something both republican and democratic governor have ask us to do to restore basic health and disability benefit when misfortune strike immigrant who come to this country legally who work hard pay tax and obey the law to do otherwise be simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrant now look ahead the great step of all the high threshold of the future we must now cross and my numb one priority for the next year be to ensure that all american have the good education in the world let's work

innovation that can make public school good we should also make it possible for much parent and teacher to start charter school school that set and meet the high standard and exist only as long as they do our plan will help america to create of this charter school by the next century nearly time as there be in the country today so that parent will have even much choice in send their child to the good school 6 character education must be teach in our school we must teach our child to be good citizen and we must continue to promote order and discipline support community that introduce school uniform impose curfew enforce truancy law remove disruptive student from the classroom and have zero tolerance for gun and drug in school 7 we cannot expect our child to raise themselves up in

classroom and library to the internet by the year so that for the first time in our history child in the much isolate rural town the much comfortable suburb the poor inner city school will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge that be my plan a call to action for american education some may say that it be unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to education some may say it be simply because the president and his wonderful wife have be obsess with this subject for much year than they can recall that be not what be drive this proposal we must understand the significance of this endeavor one of the great source of our strength throughout the cold war be a bipartisan foreign policy because our future be at stake politic stop at the wa ter's edge now i ask

family access to affordable quality health care forty million american still lack health insurance ten million child still lack health insurance percent of them have work parent who pay tax that be

community some of our child simply don't have what they need to grow and learn in their own home or school or neighborhood and that mean the rest of us must do much for they be our child too that's why president bush general colin powell former house secretary henry cisneros will join the vice president and me to lead the president's summit of service in philadelphia in april our national service program americorps have already help young people to work their way through college as they serve america now we intend to mobilize million of american to serve in thousand of way citizen

our good and service even as we preserve our value we need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy after all we have the good worker and the good product in a truly open market we can out compete anyone anywhere on earth but this be about much than economics by expand trade we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world there be no good example of this truth than latin america where democracy and open market be on the march together that be why i will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important tie we should all be proud that america lead the effort to rescue our neighbor mexico from its economic crisis and we should all be proud that last month mexico repay the unite state full year ahead of schedule with half a billion dollar profit to us america must continue to be a unrelenting force for peace from the middle east to haiti from northern ireland to africa take reasonable risk for peace keep us from be draw into far much costly

nation every dollar we devote to prevent conflict to promote democracy to stop the spread of disease and starvation bring a sure return in security and saving yet international affair spend today be just one percent of the federal budget a small fraction of what america invest in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war if america be to continue to lead the world we here who lead america simply must find the will to pay our way a farsighted america move the world to a good place over this last year and so it can be for another year but a shortsighted america

will actually be able to reduce class size in the first 2 and 3 grade to a average of student a class all across america if i've get the math right much teacher teach small class require much classroom so i also propose a school construction tax cut to help community modernize or build school we must also demand great accountability when we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't master the work we don't do that child any favor it be time to end social promotion in america's school last year in chicago they make that decision not to hold our child back but to lift them up chicago stop social promotion and start mandatory summer school to help student who be behind to catch up i propose to help other community follow chicago's lead let's say to them stop promote child

america grow and to advance a safe much stable world all of you know whatever your view be that i think this be a great opportunity for america i know there be opposition to much comprehensive trade agreement i have listen carefully and i believe that the opposition be root in two fear first that our trade partner will have low environmental and labor standard which will give them a unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favor even if there's much business and 2 that if we have much trade much of our worker will lose their job and have to start over i think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standard around the world i have make it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agendum but we cannot influence other country decision if we send them a message that we're back away from trade with them this year i will send legislation to congress and ask other nation to join us to fight the much intolerable labor practice of all abusive child labor we should also offer help and hope to that american temporarily leave behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology which may have nothing to do with trade that's why we have much than double fund for train dislocate worker since and if my new budget be adopt we will triple fund that's why we must do much and much quickly to help worker who lose their job for whatever reason you know we help community in a special way when their military base close we ought to help them in the same way if their factory close again i ask the congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of train program we have today into one single gi bill for worker a simple skill grant so people can on their own move quickly to new job to high income and bright future we all know in every way in life change be not always easy but we have to decide whether we're go to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefit and remember the big picture here while we've be enter into hundred of new trade agreement we've be create million of new job so this year we will forge new partnership with latin america asia and europe and we should pass the new african trade act it have bipartisan support i will also renew my request for the fast track negotiate authority necessary to open much new market create much new job which every president have have for two decade you know whether we like it or not in way that be mostly positive the world's economy be much and much interconnect and interdependent today a economic crisis anywhere can affect economy everywhere recent month have bring serious financial problem to thailand indonesia south korea and beyond now why should american be concern about this first this country be our customer if they sink into recession they won't be able to buy the good we'd like to sell them 2 they're also our competitor so if their currency lose their value and go down then the price of their good will drop flood our market and other with much cheap good which make it a lot tough for our people to compete and finally they be our strategic partner their stability bolster our security the american economy remain sound and strong and i want to keep it that way but because the turmoil in asia will have a impact on all the world's economy include ours make that negative impact as small as possible be the right thing to do for america and the right thing to do for a safe world our policy be clear no nation can recover if it do not reform itself but when nation be will to undertake serious economic reform we should help them do it so i call on congress to renew america's commitment to the international monetary fund and i think we should say to all the people we're try to represent here that prepare for a far off storm that may reach our shore be far wise than ignore the thunder till the cloud be just overhead a strong nation rest on the rock of responsibility a society root in responsibility must first promote the value of work not welfare we can be proud that after decade of finger point and failure together we end the old welfare system and we're now replace welfare check with paycheck last year after a record year decline in welfare roll i challenge our nation to move million much american off welfare by the year i'm please to report we have also meet that goal full year ahead of schedule this be a grand achievement the sum of many act of individual courage persistence and hope for year elaine kinslow of indianapolis indiana be on and off welfare today she's a dispatcher with

year we have to make it possible for all hard work family to meet their much important responsibility two year ago we help guarantee that american can keep their health insurance when they change job last year we extend health care to up to million child this year i challenge congress to take the next historic step a hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizen be in manage care plan this plan save money and they can improve care but medical decision ought to be make by medical doctor not insurance company accountant i urge this congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of right that say this you have the right to know all your medical option not just the cheap you have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need you have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it you have the right to keep your medical record confidential traditional care or manage care every american deserve quality care million of american between the age of and have lose their health insurance some be retire some be lay off some lose their coverage when their spouse retire after a lifetime of work they be leave with nowhere to

year thank to the pioneer leadership of all of you we have the low violent crime rate in a quarter century and the clean environment in a quarter century america be a strong force for peace from

of our future be limitless but we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency how we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depend upon what we do as a nation today so with our budget surplus grow our economy expand our confidence rise now be the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century our fiscal discipline give us a unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge the age of america with the numb of elderly american set to double by the baby boom will become a senior boom so first and above all we must save social security for the 21st century early in this century be old mean be poor when president roosevelt create social security thousand write to thank him for eliminate what one woman call the stark terror of penniless helpless old age even today without social security half our nation's elderly would be force into poverty today social security be strong but by payroll tax will no long be sufficient to cover monthly payment by the trust fund will be exhaust and social security will be unable to pay the full benefit old american have be promise the good way to keep social security a rock solid guarantee be not to make drastic cut in benefit not to raise payroll tax rate not to drain resource from social security in the name of save it instead i propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save social security specifically i propose that we commit percent of the budget surplus for the next year to social security invest a small portion in the private sector just as any private or state government pension would do this will earn a high return and keep social security sound for year but we must aim high we should put social security on a sound foot for the next year we should reduce poverty among elderly woman who be nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other senior and we should eliminate the limit on what senior on social security can earn now this change will require difficult but fully achievable choice over and above the dedication of the surplus they must be make on a bipartisan basis they should be make this year so let me say to you tonight i reach out my hand to all of you in both house in both party and ask that we join together in say to the american people we will save social security now now last year we wisely reserve all of the surplus until we know what it would take to save social security again i say we shouldn't spend any of it not any of it until after social security be truly save first thing first 2 once we have save social security we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve medicare already we have extend the life of the medicare trust fund by year but we should extend it for at less another decade tonight i propose that we use one out of every in the surplus for the next year to guarantee the soundness of medicare until the year but again we should aim high we must be will to work in a bipartisan way and look at new idea include the upcoming report of the bipartisan medicare commission if we work together we can secure medicare for the next two decade and cover the great grow need of senior affordable prescription drug 3 we must help all american from their first day on the job to save to invest to create wealth from its begin american have supplement social security with private pension and saving yet today million of people retire with little to live on other than social security american live long than ever simply must save much than ever therefore in addition to save social security and medicare i propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century i propose that we use a little over percent of the surplus to establish universal saving account usa account to give all american the mean to save with this new account american can invest as they choose and receive fund to match a portion of their saving with extra help for that less able to save usa account will help all american to share in our nation's wealth and to enjoy a much secure retirement i ask you to support them 4 we must invest in long term care i propose a tax credit of for the age ail or disable and the family who care for them long term care will become a big and big challenge with the age of america and we must do much to help our family deal with it i be bear in the first year of the baby boom i can tell you that one of the great concern of our generation be our absolute determination not to let our grow old place a intolerable burden on our child and their ability to raise our grandchild our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us a opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulder and we should take it save social security medicare create usa account this be the right way to use the surplus if we do so if we do so we will still have resource to meet critical need in education and defense and i want to point out that this proposal be fiscally sound listen to this if we set aside percent of the surplus for social security and percent for medicare over the next year that save will achieve the low level of publicly hold debt since right before world war i in so with this four measure save social security strengthen medicare establish the usa account support long term care we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century senior now there be much child from much diverse background in our public school than at any time in our history their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire nation to thrive in the new economy today we can say something we couldn't say year ago with tax credit and much affordable student loan with much work study grant and much pell grant with education ira's and the new hope scholarship tax cut that much than million american will receive this year we have finally open the door of college to all american with our support nearly every state have set high academic standard for public school and a voluntary national test be be develop to measure the progress of our student with over billion in discount available this year we be good on our way to our goal of connect every classroom and library to the internet last fall you pass our proposal to start hire new teacher to reduce class size in the early grade now i ask you to finish the job you know our child be do good sit score be up math score have rise in nearly all grade but there's a problem while our 4 grader outperform their peer in other country in math and science our 8 grader be around average and our 12 grader rank near the bottom we must do good now each year the national government invest much than billion in our public school i believe we must change the way we invest that money to support what work and to stop support what do not work first late this year i will send to congress a plan that for the first time hold state and school district accountable for progress and reward them for result my education accountability act will require every school district receive federal help to take the follow five step first all school must end social promotion no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read we do our child no favor when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without master the material but we can't just hold student back because the system fail them so my balance budget triple the fund for summer school and after school program to keep a million child learn now if you doubt this will work just look at chicago which end social promotion and make summer school mandatory for that who don't master the basic math and read score be up year run with some of the big gain in some of the poor neighborhood it will work and we should do it 2 all state and school district must turn around their bad perform school or shut them down that's the policy establish in north carolina by governor jim hunt north carolina make the big gain in test score in the nation last year our budget include million to help state turn around their own fail school 3 all state and school district must be hold responsible for the quality of their teacher the great majority of our teacher do a fine job but in too many school teacher don't have college major or even minor in the subject they teach new teacher should be require to pass performance exam and all teacher should know the subject they're teach this year's balance budget contain resource to help them reach high standard and to attract talented young teacher to the tough assignment i recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarship for student who commit to teach in the inner city and isolate rural area and in indian community let us bring excellence in every part of america 4 we must empower parent with much information and much choice in too many community it's easy to get information on the quality of the local restaurant than on the quality of the local school every school district should issue report card on every school and parent should be give much choice in select their public school when i become president there be just one independent public charter school in all america with our support on a bipartisan basis today there be my budget assure that early in the next century there will be 5 to assure that our classroom be truly place of learn and to respond to what teacher have be ask us to do for year we should say that all state and school district must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policy now let's do one much thing for our child today too many school be so old they're fall apart or so over crowd student be learn in trailer last fall congress miss the opportunity to change that this year with million child in our school congress must not miss that opportunity again i ask you to help our community build or modernize school if we do this thing end social promotion turn around fail school build modern one support qualify teacher promote innovation competition and discipline then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century school now we also have to do much to support the million of parent who give their all every day at home and at work the much basic tool of all be a decent income so let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar a hour over the next year and let's make sure that woman and man get equal pay for equal work by
