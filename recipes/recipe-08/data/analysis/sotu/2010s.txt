madame speaker vice president biden member of congress distinguish guest and fellow american our constitution declare that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union for two hundred and twenty year our leader have fulfill this duty they have do so during period of prosperity and tranquility and they have do so in the midst of war and depression at moment of great strife and great struggle it's tempt to look back on this moment and assume that our progress be inevitable that america be always destine to succeed but when the union be turn back at bull run and the ally first land at omaha beach victory be very much in doubt when the market crash on black tuesday and civil right marcher be beat on bloody sunday the future be anything but certain this be time that test the courage of our conviction and the strength of our union and despite all our division and disagreement our hesitation and our fear america prevail because we choose to move forward as one nation and one people again we be test and again we must answer history's call one year ago i take office amid two war a economy rock by severe recession a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt expert from across the political spectrum warn that if we do not act we may face a 2 depression so we act immediately and aggressively and one year late the bad of the storm have pass but the devastation remain one in ten american still cannot find work many business have shutter home value have decline small town and rural community have be hit especially hard for that who have already know poverty life have become that much hard this recession have also compound the burden that america's family have be deal with for decade the burden of work hard and long for little of be unable to save enough to retire or help kid with college so i know the anxiety that be out there right now they're not new this struggle be the reason i run for president this struggle be what i've witness for year in place like elkhart indiana and galesburg illinois i hear about them in the letter that i read each night the tough to read be that write by child ask why they have to move from their home or when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work for this american and so many other change have not come fast enough some be frustrate some be angry they don't understand why it seem like bad behavior on wall street be reward but hard work on main street isn't or why washington have be unable or unwilling to solve any of our problem they be tire of the partisanship and the shout and the pettiness they know we can't afford it not now so we face big and difficult challenge and what the american people hope what they deserve be for all of us democrat and republican to work through our difference to overcome the numb weight of our politic for while the people who send us here have different background different story and different belief the anxiety they face be the same the aspiration they hold be share a job that pay the bill a chance to get ahead much of all the ability to give their child a good life you know what else they share they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity after one of the much difficult year in our history they remain busy build car and teach kid start business and go back to school they're coach little league and help their neighbor as one woman write me we be strain but hopeful struggle but encourage it be because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that i have never be much hopeful about america's future than i be tonight despite our hardship our union be strong we do not give up we do not quit we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit in this new decade it's time the american people get a government that match their decency that embody their strength and tonight i'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise it begin with our economy our much urgent task upon take office be to shore up the same bank that help cause this crisis it be not easy to do and if there's one thing that have unify democrat and republican it's that we all hate the bank bailout i hate it you hate it it be about as popular as a root canal but when i run for president i promise i wouldn't just do what be popular i would do what be necessary and if we have allow the meltdown of the financial system unemployment may be double what it be today much business would certainly have close much home would have surely be lose so i support the last administration's effort to create the financial rescue program and when we take the program over we make it much transparent and accountable as a result the market be now stabilize and we have recover much of the money we spend on the bank to recover the rest i have propose a fee on the big bank i know wall street isn't keen on this idea but if this firm can afford to hand out big bonus again they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayer who rescue them in their time of need as we stabilize the financial system we also take step to get our economy grow again save as many job as possible and help american who have become unemployed that's why we extend or increase unemployment benefit for much than million american make health insurance cheap for family who get their coverage through cobra and pass different tax cut let me repeat we cut tax we cut tax for of work family we cut tax for small business we cut tax for first time homebuyer we cut tax for parent try to care for their child we cut tax for million american pay for college as a result million of american have much to spend on gas and food and other necessity all of which help business keep much worker and we haven't raise income tax by a single dime on a single person not a single dime because of the step we take there be about two million american work right now who would otherwise be unemployed work in construction and clean energy be teacher and other education worker ten of thousand be cop firefighter correctional officer and first responder and we be on track to add another one and a half million job to this total by the end of the year the plan that have make all of this possible from the tax cut to the job be the recovery act that's right the recovery act also know as the stimulus bill economist on the leave and the right say that this bill have help save job and avert disaster but you don't have to take their word for it talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who say he use to be skeptical about the recovery act until he have to add two much work shift just because of the business it create talk to the single teacher raise two kid who be tell by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act she wouldn't be lay off after all there be story like this all across america and after two year of recession the economy be grow again retirement fund have start to gain back some of their value business be begin to invest again and slowly some be start to hire again but i realize that for every success story there be other story of man and woman who wake up with the anguish of not know where their next paycheck will come from who send out resume week after week and hear nothing in response that be why job must be our numb one focus in and that be why i be call for a new job bill tonight now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america's business but government can create the condition necessary for business to expand and hire much worker we should start where much new job do in small business company that begin when a entrepreneur take a chance on a dream or a worker decide its time she become her own boss through sheer grit and determination this company have weather the recession and be ready to grow but when you talk to small business owner in place like allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio you find out that even though bank on wall street be lend again they be mostly lend to big company but finance remain difficult for small business owner across the country so tonight i'm propose that we take billion of the money wall street bank have repay and use it to help community bank give small business the credit they need to stay afloat i be also propose a new small business tax credit one that will go to over one million small business who hire new worker or raise wage while we're at it let's also eliminate all capital gain tax on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all business large and small to invest in new plant and equipment next we can put american to work today build the infrastructure of tomorrow from the first railroad to the interstate highway system our nation have always be build to compete there's no reason europe or china should have the fast train or the new factory that manufacture clean energy product tomorrow i'll visit tampa florida where worker will soon break grind on a new high speed railroad fund by the recovery act there be project like that all across this country that will create job and help our nation move good service and information we should put much american to work build clean energy facility and give rebate to american who make their home much energy efficient which support clean energy job and to encourage this and other business to stay within our border it's time to finally slash the tax break for company that ship our job overseas and give that tax break to company that create job in the unite state of america the house have pass a job bill that include some of this step as the first order of business this year i urge the senate to do the same people be out of work they be hurt they need our help and i want a job bill on my desk without delay but the truth be this step still won't make up for the seven million job we've lose over the last two year the only way to move to full employment be to lie a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problem that america's family have confront for year we cannot afford another so call economic expansion like the one from last decade what some call the lose decade where job grow much slowly than during any prior expansion where the income of the average american household decline while the cost of health care and tuition reach record high where prosperity be build on a house bubble and financial speculation from the day i take office i have be tell that address our large challenge be too ambitious that such effort would be too contentious that our political system be too gridlocked and that we should just put thing on hold for awhile for that who make this claim i have one simple question how long should we wait how long should america put its future on hold you see washington have be tell us to wait for decade even as the problem have grow bad meanwhile china's not wait to revamp its economy germany's not wait india's not wait this nation aren't stand still this nation aren't play for 2 place they're putting much emphasis on math and science they're rebuild their infrastructure they be make serious investment in clean energy because they want that job good i do not accept 2 place for the unite state of america as hard as it may be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debate may be it's time to get serious about fix the problem that be hamper our growth one place to start be serious financial reform look i be not interest in punish bank i'm interest in protect our economy a strong healthy financial market make it possible for business to access credit and create new job it channel the saving of family into investment that raise income but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly bring down our entire economy we need to make sure consumer and middle class family have the information they need to make financial decision we can't allow financial institution include that that take your deposit to take risk that threaten the whole economy the house have already pass financial reform with many of this change and the lobbyist be already try to kill it good we cannot let them win this fight and if the bill that end up on my desk do not meet the test of real reform i will send it back next we need to encourage american innovation last year we make the large investment in basic research fund in history a investment that can lead to the world's cheap solar cell or treatment that kill cancer cell but leave healthy one untouched and no area be much ripe for such innovation than energy you can see the result of last year's investment in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create job nationwide help to make advance battery or in the california business that will put people to work make solar panel but to create much of this clean energy job we need much production much efficiency much incentive that mean build a new generation of safe clean nuclear power plant in this country it mean make tough decision about open new offshore area for oil and gas development it mean continue investment in advance biofuel and clean coal technology and yes it mean pass a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentive that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america i be grateful to the house for pass such a bill last year this year i be eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate i know there have be question about whether we can afford such change in a tough economy and i know that there be that who disagree with the overwhelm scientific evidence on climate change but even if you doubt the evidence provide incentive for energy efficiency and clean energy be the right thing to do for our future because the nation that lead the clean energy economy will be the nation that lead the global economy and america must be that nation 3 we need to export much of our good because the much product we make and sell to other country the much job we support right here in america so tonight we set a new goal we will double our export over the next five year a increase that will support two million job in america to help meet this goal we're launch a national export initiative that will help farmer and small business increase their export and reform export control consistent with national security we have to seek new market aggressively just as our competitor be if america sit on the sideline while other nation sign trade deal we will lose the chance to create job on our shore but realize that benefit also mean enforce that agreement so our trade partner play by the rule and that's why we will continue to shape a doha trade agreement that open global market and why we will strengthen our trade relation in asia and with key partner like south korea panama and colombia 4 we need to invest in the skill and education of our people this year we have break through the stalemate between leave and right by launch a national competition to improve our school the idea here be simple instead of reward failure we only reward success instead of fund the status quo we only invest in reform reform that raise student achievement inspire student to excel in math and science and turn around fail school that steal the future of too many young american from rural community to inner city in the 21st century one of the good anti poverty program be a world class education in this country the success of our child cannot depend much on where they live than their potential when we renew the elementary and secondary education act we will work with congress to expand this reform to all fifty state still in this economy a high school diploma no long guarantee a good job i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community college which be a career pathway to the child of so many work family to make college much affordable this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank for student loan instead let's take that money and give family a tax credit for four year of college and increase pell grant and let's tell another one million student that when they graduate they will be require to pay only ten percent of their income on student loan and all of their debt will be forgive after twenty year and forgive after ten year if they choose a career in public service because in the unite state of america no one should go break because they choose to go to college and it's time for college and university to get serious about cut their own cost because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem now the price of college tuition be just one of the burden face the middle class that's why last year i ask vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class family that's why we're nearly double the child care tax credit and make it easy to save for retirement by give every worker access to a retirement account and expand the tax credit for that who start a nest egg that's why we're work to lift the value of a family's single large investment their home the step we take last year to shore up the house market have allow million of american to take out new loan and save a average of on mortgage payment this year we will step up re finance so that homeowner can move into much affordable mortgage and it be precisely to relieve the burden on middle class family that we still need health insurance reform now let's be clear i do not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didn't take on health care because it be good politic i take on health care because of the story i've hear from american with pre exist condition whose life depend on get coverage patient who've be deny coverage and family even that with insurance who be just one illness away from financial ruin after nearly a century of try we be close than ever to bring much security to the life of so many american the approach we've take would protect every american from the bad practice of the insurance industry it would give small business and uninsured american a chance to choose a affordable health care plan in a competitive market it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care and by the way i want to acknowledge our first lady michelle obama who this year be create a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make our kid healthy our approach would preserve the right of american who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan it would reduce cost and premium for million of family and business and accord to the congressional budget office the independent organization that both party have cite as the official scorekeeper for congress our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as trillion over the next two decade still this be a complex issue and the long it be debate the much skeptical people become i take my share of the blame for not explain it much clearly to the american people and i know that with all the lobby and horse trade this process leave much american wonder what's in it for them but i also know this problem be not go away by the time i'm finish speak tonight much american will have lose their health insurance million will lose it this year our deficit will grow premium will go up patient will be deny the care they need small business owner will continue to drop coverage altogether i will not walk away from this american and neither should the people in this chamber as temperature cool i want everyone to take another look at the plan we've propose there's a reason why many doctor nurse and health care expert who know our system good consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if anyone from either party have a good approach that will bring down premium bring down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for senior and stop insurance company abuse let me know here's what i ask of congress though do not walk away from reform not now not when we be so close let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people now even as health care reform would reduce our deficit it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves it's a challenge that make all other that much hard to solve and one that's be subject to a lot of political posture so let me start the discussion of government spend by set the record straight at the begin of the last decade america have a budget surplus of over billion by the time i take office we have a one year deficit of over trillion and project deficit of trillion over the next decade much of this be the result of not pay for two war two tax cut and a expensive prescription drug program on top of that the effect of the recession put a trillion hole in our budget that be before i walk in the door now if we have take office in ordinary time i would have like nothing much than to start bring down the deficit but we take office amid a crisis and our effort to prevent a 2 depression have add another trillion to our national debt i be absolutely convince that be the right thing to do but family across the country be tighten their belt and make tough decision the federal government should do the same so tonight i'm propose specific step to pay for the trillion that it take to rescue the economy last year start in we be prepare to freeze government spend for three year spend relate to our national security medicare medicaid and social security will not be affect but all other discretionary government program will like any cash strap family we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto i will we will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate program that we can't afford and don't work we've already identify billion in saving for next year to help work family we will extend our middle class tax cut but at a time of record deficit we will not continue tax cut for oil company investment fund manager and that make over a year we just can't afford it now even after pay for what we spend on my watch we will still face the massive deficit we have when i take office much importantly the cost of medicare medicaid and social security will continue to skyrocket that's why i've call for a bipartisan fiscal commission model on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad this can't be one of that washington gimmick that let us pretend we solve a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solution by a certain deadline yesterday the senate block a bill that would have create this commission so i will issue a executive order that will allow us to go forward because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of american and when the vote come tomorrow the senate should restore the pay as you go law that be a big reason why we have record surplus in the 1990s i know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze government spend when so many be still hurt i agree which be why this freeze will not take effect until next year when the economy be strong but understand if we do not take meaningful step to rein in our debt it can damage our market increase the cost of borrow and jeopardize our recovery all of which can have a even bad effect on our job growth and family income from some on the right i expect we'll hear a different argument that if we just make few investment in our people extend tax cut for wealthy american eliminate much regulation and maintain the status quo on health care our deficit will go away the problem be that's what we do for eight year that's what help lead us into this crisis it's what help lead to this deficit and we cannot do it again rather than fight the same tire battle that have dominate washington for decade it's time to try something new let's invest in our people without leave them a mountain of debt let's meet our responsibility to the citizen who send us here let's try common sense to do that we have to recognize that we face much than a deficit of dollar right now we face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubt about how washington work that have be grow for year to close that credibility gap we must take action on both end of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyist to do our work openly and to give our people the government they deserve that's what i come to washington to do that's why for the first time in history my administration post our white house visitor online and that's why we've exclude lobbyist from policy make job or seat on federal board and commission but we can't stop there it's time to require lobbyist to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or congress and it's time to put strict limit on the contribution that lobbyist give to candidate for federal office last week the supreme court reverse a century of law to open the floodgate for special interest include foreign corporation to spend without limit in our election good i don't think american election should be bankroll by america's much powerful interest or bad by foreign entity they should be decide by the american people and that's why i'm urge democrat and republican to pass a bill that help to right this wrong i'm also call on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform you have trim some of this spend and embrace some meaningful change but restore the public trust demand much for example some member of congress post some earmark request online tonight i'm call on congress to publish all earmark request on a single website before there's a vote so that the american people can see how their money be be spend of course none of this reform will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another now i be not naïve i never think the mere fact of my election would usher in peace harmony and some post partisan era i know that both party have feed division that be deeply entrench and on some issue there be simply philosophical difference that will always cause us to part way this disagreement about the role of government in our life about our national priority and our national security have be take place for over two hundred year they be the very essence of our democracy but what frustrate the american people be a washington where every day be election day we cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal be to see who can get the much embarrass headline about their opponent a belief that if you lose i win neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can the confirmation of good qualify public servant should not be hold hostage to the pet project or grudge of a few individual senator washington may think that say anything about the other side no matter how false be just part of the game but it be precisely such politic that have stop either party from help the american people bad yet it be sow far division among our citizen and far distrust in our government so no i will not give up on change the tone of our politic i know it's a election year and after last week it be clear that campaign fever have come even early than usual but we still need to govern to democrat i would remind you that we still have the large majority in decade and the people expect us to solve some problem not run for the hill and if the republican leadership be go to insist that sixty vote in the senate be require to do any business at all in this town then the responsibility to govern be now yours as good just say no to everything may be good short term politic but it's not leadership we be send here to serve our citizen not our ambition so let's show the american people that we can do it together this week i'll be address a meet of the house republican and i would like to begin monthly meeting with both the democratic and republican leadership i know you can't wait throughout our history no issue have unite this country much than our security sadly some of the unity we feel after have dissipate we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this but i be not interest in re litigate the past i know that all of us love this country all of us be commit to its defense so let's put aside the schoolyard taunt about who be tough let's reject the false choice between protect our people and uphold our value let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it take to defend our nation and forge a much hopeful future for america and the world that be the work we begin last year since the day i take office we have renew our focus on the terrorist who threaten our nation we have make substantial investment in our homeland security and disrupt plot that threaten to take american life we be fill unacceptable gap reveal by the fail christmas attack with good airline security and swift action on our intelligence we have prohibit torture and strengthen partnership from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula and in the last year hundred of al qaeda's fighter and affiliate include many senior leader have be capture or kill far much than in in afghanistan we be increase our troop and train afghan security force so they can begin to take the lead in july of and our troop can begin to come home we will reward good governance reduce corruption and support the right of all afghan man and woman alike we be join by ally and partner who have increase their own commitment and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose there will be difficult day ahead but i be confident we will succeed as we take the fight to al qaeda we be responsibly leave iraq to its people as a candidate i promise that i would end this war and that be what i be do as president we will have all of our combat troop out of iraq by the end of this august we will support the iraqi government as they hold election and continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity but make no mistake this war be end and all of our troop be come home tonight all of our man and woman in uniform in iraq afghanistan and around the world must know that they have our respect our gratitude and our full support and just as they must have the resource they need in war we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home that be why we make the large increase in investment for veteran in decade that be why we be build a 21st century va and that be why michelle have join with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military family even as we prosecute two war we be also confront perhaps the great danger to the american people the threat of nuclear weapon i have embrace the vision of john f kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverse the spread of this weapon and seek a world without them to reduce our stockpile and launcher while ensure our deterrent the unite state and russia be complete negotiation on the far reach arm control treaty in nearly two decade and at april's nuclear security summit we will bring forty four nation together behind a clear goal secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in four year so that they never fall into the hand of terrorist this diplomatic effort have also strengthen our hand in deal with that nation that insist on violate international agreement in pursuit of this weapon that be why north korea now face increase isolation and strong sanction sanction that be be vigorously enforce that be why the international community be much unite and the islamic republic of iran be much isolate and as iran's leader continue to ignore their obligation there should be no doubt they too will face grow consequence that be the leadership that we be provide engagement that advance the common security and prosperity of all people we be work through the g to sustain a last global recovery we be work with muslim community around the world to promote science education and innovation we have go from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change we be help develop country to fee themselves and continue the fight against hiv aid and we be launch a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond fast and much effectively to bio terrorism or a infectious disease a plan that will counter threat at home and strengthen public health abroad as we have for over sixty year america take this action because our destiny be connect to that beyond our shore but we also do it because it be right that be why as we meet here tonight over american be work with many nation to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild that be why we stand with the girl who yearn to go to school in afghanistan we support the human right of the woman march through the street of iran and we advocate for the young man deny a job by corruption in guinea for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity abroad america's great source of strength have always be our ideal the same be true at home we find unity in our incredible diversity draw on the promise enshrine in our constitution the notion that we be all create equal that no matter who you be or what you look like if you abide by the law you should be protect by it that if you adhere to our common value you should be treat no different than anyone else we must continually renew this promise my administration have a civil right division that be once again prosecute civil right violation and employment discrimination we finally strengthen our law to protect against crime drive by hate this year i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that deny gay american the right to serve the country they love because of who they be we be go to crack down on violation of equal pay law so that woman get equal pay for a equal day's work and we should continue the work of fix our break immigration system to secure our border enforce our law and ensure that everyone who play by the rule can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation in the end it be our ideal our value that build america value that allow us to forge a nation make up of immigrant from every corner of the globe value that drive our citizen still every day american meet their responsibility to their family and their employer time and again they lend a hand to their neighbor and give back to their country they take pride in their labor and be generous in spirit this aren't republican value or democratic value they're live by business value or labor value they be american value unfortunately too many of our citizen have lose faith that our big institution our corporation our medium and yes our government still reflect this same value each of this institution be full of honorable man and woman do important work that help our country prosper but each time a ceo reward himself for failure or a banker put the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain people's doubt grow each time lobbyist game the system or politician tear each other down instead of lift this country up we lose faith the much that tv pundit reduce serious debate into silly argument and big issue into sound bite our citizen turn away no wonder there's so much cynicism out there no wonder there's so much disappointment i campaign on the promise of change change we can believe in the slogan go and right now i know there be many american who aren't sure if they still believe we can change or at less that i can deliver it but remember this i never suggest that change would be easy or that i can do it alone democracy in a nation of three hundred million people can be noisy and messy and complicate and when you try to do big thing and make big change it stir passion and controversy that's just how it be that of us in public office can respond to this reality by play it safe and avoid tell hard truth we can do what's necessary to keep our poll number high and get through the next election instead of do what's good for the next generation but i also know this if people have make that decision fifty year ago or one hundred year ago or two hundred year ago we wouldn't be here tonight the only reason we be be because generation of american be unafraid to do what be hard to do what be need even when success be uncertain to do what it take to keep the dream of this nation alive for their child and grandchild our administration have have some political setback this year and some of them be deserve but i wake up every day know that they be nothing compare to the setback that family all across this country have face this year and what keep me go what keep me fight be that despite all this setback that spirit of determination and optimism that fundamental decency that have always be at the core of the american people life on it life on in the struggle small business owner who write to me of his company none of us he say be will to consider even slightly that we may fail it life on in the woman who say that even though she and her neighbor have feel the pain of recession we be strong we be resilient we be american it life on in the year old boy in louisiana who just send me his allowance and ask if i would give it to the people of haiti and it life on in all the american who've drop everything to go some place they've never be and pull people they've never know from rubble prompt chant of u.s.a u.s.a u.s.a when another life be save the spirit that have sustain this nation for much than two century life on in you its people we have finish a difficult year we have come through a difficult decade but a new year have come a new decade stretch before us we don't quit i don't quit let's seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once much thank you god bless you and god bless the unite state of america tonight i want to begin by congratulate the man and woman of the 112th congress as good as your new speaker john boehner and as we mark this occasion we be also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber and pray for the health of our colleague and our friend gabby giffords it's no secret that that of us here tonight have have our difference over the last two year the debate have be contentious we have fight fiercely for our belief and that's a good thing that's what a robust democracy demand that's what help set us apart as a nation but there's a reason the tragedy in tucson give us pause amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate tucson remind us that no matter who we be or where we come from each of us be a part of something great something much consequential than party or political preference we be part of the american family we believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be find we be still bind together as one people that we share common hope and a common creed that the dream of a little girl in tucson be not so different than that of our own child and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfill that too be what set us apart as a nation now by itself this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation what come of this moment be up to us what come of this moment will be determine not by whether we can sit together tonight but whether we can work together tomorrow i believe we can i believe we must that's what the people who send us here expect of us with their vote they've determine that govern will now be a share responsibility between party new law will only pass with support from democrat and republican we will move forward together or not at all for the challenge we face be big than party and big than politic at stake right now be not who win the next election after all we just have a election at stake be whether new job and industry take root in this country or somewhere else it's whether the hard work and industry of our people be reward it's whether we sustain the leadership that have make america not just a place on a map but a light to the world we be poise for progress two year after the bad recession much of us have ever know the stock market have come roar back corporate profit be up the economy be grow again but we have never measure progress by this yardstick alone we measure progress by the success of our people by the job they can find and the quality of life that job offer by the prospect of a small business owner who dream of turn a good idea into a thrive enterprise by the opportunity for a good life that we pass on to our child that's the project the american people want us to work on together we do that in december thank to the tax cut we pass american paycheck be a little big today every business can write off the full cost of the new investment they make this year this step take by democrat and republican will grow the economy and add to the much than one million private sector job create last year but we have much work to do the step we've take over the last two year may have break the back of this recession but to win the future we'll need to take on challenge that have be decade in the make many people watch tonight can probably remember a time when find a good job mean show up at a nearby factory or a business downtown you didn't always need a degree and your competition be pretty much limit to your neighbor if you work hard chance be you'd have a job for life with a decent paycheck good benefit and the occasional promotion maybe you'd even have the pride of see your kid work at the same company that world have change and for many the change have be painful i've see it in the shutter window of once boom factory and the vacant storefront of once busy main street i've hear it in the frustration of american who've see their paycheck dwindle or their job disappear proud man and woman who feel like the rule have be change in the middle of the game they're right the rule have change in a single generation revolution in technology have transform the way we live work and do business steel mill that once need worker can now do the same work with today just about any company can set up shop hire worker and sell their product wherever there's a internet connection meanwhile nation like china and india realize that with some change of their own they can compete in this new world and so they start educate their child early and long with great emphasis on math and science they're invest in research and new technology just recently china become home to the world's large private solar research facility and the world's fast computer so yes the world have change the competition for job be real but this shouldn't discourage us it should challenge us remember for all the hit we've take this last few year for all the naysayer predict our decline america still have the large much prosperous economy in the world no worker be much productive than ours no country have much successful company or grant much patent to inventor and entrepreneur we be home to the world's good college and university where much student come to study than any other place on earth what's much we be the first nation to be found for the sake of a idea the idea that each of us deserve the chance to shape our own destiny that be why century of pioneer and immigrant have risk everything to come here it's why our student don't just memorize equation but answer question like what do you think of that idea what would you change about the world what do you want to be when you grow up the future be ours to win but to get there we can't just stand still as robert kennedy tell us the future be not a gift it be a achievement sustain the american dream have never be about stand pat it have require each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the demand of a new age now it's our turn we know what it take to compete for the job and industry of our time we need to out innovate out educate and out build the rest of the world we have to make america the good place on earth to do business we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government that's how our people will prosper that's how we'll win the future and tonight i'd like to talk about how we get there the first step in win the future be encourage american innovation none of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new job will come from thirty year ago we couldn't know that something call the internet would lead to a economic revolution what we can do what america do good than anyone be spark the creativity and imagination of our people we be the nation that put car in driveway and computer in office the nation of edison and the wright brother of google and facebook in america innovation doesn't just change our life it's how we make a live our free enterprise system be what drive innovation but because it's not always profitable for company to invest in basic research throughout history our government have provide cut edge scientist and inventor with the support that they need that's what plant the seed for the internet that's what help make possible thing like computer chip and gp just think of all the good job from manufacture to retail that have come from that breakthrough half a century ago when the soviet beat us into space with the launch of a satellite call sputnik we have no idea how we'd beat them to the moon the science wasn't there yet nasa didn't even exist but after invest in good research and education we didn't just surpass the soviet we unleash a wave of innovation that create new industry and million of new job this be our generation's sputnik moment two year ago i say that we need to reach a level of research and development we haven't see since the height of the space race in a few week i will be send a budget to congress that help us meet that goal we'll invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology a investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create countless new job for our people already we be see the promise of renewable energy robert and gary allen be brother who run a small michigan roof company after september 11th they volunteer their good roofer to help repair the pentagon but half of their factory go unused and the recession hit them hard today with the help of a government loan that empty space be be use to manufacture solar shingle that be be sell all across the country in robert's word we reinvent ourselves that's what american have do for over two hundred year reinvent ourselves and to spur on much success story like the allen brother we've begin to reinvent our energy policy we're not just hand out money we're issue a challenge we're tell america's scientist and engineer that if they assemble team of the good mind in their field and focus on the hard problem in clean energy we'll fund the apollo project of our time at the california institute of technology they're develop a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our car at oak ridge national laboratory they're use supercomputer to get a lot much power out of our nuclear facility with much research and incentive we can break our dependence on oil with biofuel and become the first country to have million electric vehicle on the road by we need to get behind this innovation and to help pay for it i'm ask congress to eliminate the billion in taxpayer dollar we currently give to oil company i don't know if you've notice but they're do just fine on their own so instead of subsidize yesterday's energy let's invest in tomorrow's now clean energy breakthrough will only translate into clean energy job if business know there will be a market for what they're sell so tonight i challenge you to join me in set a new goal by of america's electricity will come from clean energy source some folk want wind and solar other want nuclear clean coal and natural gas to meet this goal we will need them all and i urge democrat and republican to work together to make it happen maintain our leadership in research and technology be crucial to america's success but if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce job in america and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kid think about it over the next ten year nearly half of all new job will require education that go beyond a high school degree and yet as many as a quarter of our student aren't even finish high school the quality of our math and science education lag behind many other nation america have fall to 9th in the proportion of young people with a college degree and so the question be whether all of us as citizen and as parent be will to do what's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed that responsibility begin not in our classroom but in our home and community it's family that first instill the love of learn in a child only parent can make sure the tv be turn off and homework get do we need to teach our kid that it's not just the winner of the super bowl who deserve to be celebrate but the winner of the science fair that success be not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline our school share this responsibility when a child walk into a classroom it should be a place of high expectation and high performance but too many school don't meet this test that's why instead of just pour money into a system that's not work we launch a competition call race to the top to all fifty state we say if you show us the much innovative plan to improve teacher quality and student achievement we'll show you the money race to the top be the much meaningful reform of our public school in a generation for little than one percent of what we spend on education each year it have lead over state to raise their standard for teach and learn this standard be develop not by washington but by republican and democratic governor throughout the country and race to the top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace no child leave behind with a law that be much flexible and focus on what's good for our kid you see we know what's possible for our child when reform isn't just a top down mandate but the work of local teacher and principal school board and community take a school like bruce randolph in denver three year ago it be rate one of the bad school in colorado locate on turf between two rival gang but last may of the senior receive their diploma much will be the first in their family to go to college and after the first year of the school's transformation the principal who make it possible wipe away tear when a student say thank you mrs water for show that we be smart and we can make it let's also remember that after parent the big impact on a child's success come from the man or woman at the front of the classroom in south korea teacher be know as nation builder here in america it's time we treat the people who educate our child with the same level of respect we want to reward good teacher and stop make excuse for bad one and over the next ten year with so many baby boomer retire from our classroom we want to prepare new teacher in the field of science technology engineer and math in fact to every young person listen tonight who's contemplate their career choice if you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher your country need you of course the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma to compete high education must be within reach of every american that's why we've end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank and use the saving to make college affordable for million of student and this year i ask congress to go far and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth for four year of college because people need to be able to train for new job and career in today's fast change economy we be also revitalize america's community college last month i see the promise of this school at forsyth tech in north carolina many of the student there use to work in the surround factory that have since leave town one mother of two a woman name kathy proctor have work in the furniture industry since she be year old and she tell me she's earn her degree in biotechnology now at year old not just because the furniture job be go but because she want to inspire her child to pursue their dream too as kathy say i hope it tell them to never give up if we take this step if we raise expectation for every child and give them the good possible chance at a education from the day they're bear until the last job they take we will reach the goal i set two year ago by the end of the decade america will once again have the high proportion of college graduate in the world one last point about education today there be hundred of thousand of student excel in our school who be not american citizen some be the child of undocumented worker who have nothing to do with the action of their parent they grow up as american and pledge allegiance to our flag and yet live every day with the threat of deportation other come here from abroad to study in our college and university but as soon as they obtain advance degree we send them back home to compete against us it make no sense now i strongly believe that we should take on once and for all the issue of illegal immigration i be prepare to work with republican and democrat to protect our border enforce our law and address the million of undocumented worker who be now live in the shadow i know that debate will be difficult and take time but tonight let's agree to make that effort and let's stop expel talented responsible young people who can staff our research lab start new business and far enrich this nation the 3 step in win the future be rebuild america to attract new business to our shore we need the fast much reliable way to move people good and information from high speed rail to high speed internet our infrastructure use to be the good but our lead have slip south korean home now have great internet access than we do country in europe and russia invest much in their road and railway than we do china be build fast train and new airport meanwhile when our own engineer grade our nation's infrastructure they give us a have we have to do good america be the nation that build the transcontinental railroad bring electricity to rural community and construct the interstate highway system the job create by this project didn't just come from lay down track or pavement they come from business that open near a town's new train station or the new off ramp over the last two year we have begin rebuild for the 21st century a project that have mean thousand of good job for the hard hit construction industry tonight i'm propose that we redouble this effort we will put much american to work repair crumble road and bridge we will make sure this be fully pay for attract private investment and pick project base on what's good for the economy not politician within year our goal be to give of american access to high speed rail which can allow you go place in half the time it take to travel by car for some trip it will be fast than fly without the pat down as we speak route in california and the midwest be already underway within the next five year we will make it possible for business to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to of all american this isn't just about a fast internet and few drop call it's about connect every part of america to the digital age it's about a rural community in iowa or alabama where farmer and small business owner will be able to sell their product all over the world it's about a firefighter who can download the design of a burn build onto a handheld device a student who can take class with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chat with her doctor all this investment in innovation education and infrastructure will make america a good place to do business and create job but to help our company compete we also have to knock down barrier that stand in the way of their success over the year a parade of lobbyist have rig the tax code to benefit particular company and industry that with accountant or lawyer to work the system can end up pay no tax at all but all the rest be hit with one of the high corporate tax rate in the world it make no sense and it have to change so tonight i'm ask democrat and republican to simplify the system get rid of the loophole level the play field and use the saving to low the corporate tax rate for the first time in year without add to our deficit to help business sell much product abroad we set a goal of double our export by because the much we export the much job we create at home already our export be up recently we sign agreement with india and china that will support much than job in the unite state and last month we finalize a trade agreement with south korea that will support at less american job this agreement have unprecedented support from business and labor democrat and republican and i ask this congress to pass it as soon as possible before i take office i make it clear that we would enforce our trade agreement and that i would only sign deal that keep faith with american worker and promote american job that's what we do with korea and that's what i intend to do as we pursue agreement with panama and colombia and continue our asia pacific and global trade talk to reduce barrier to growth and investment i've order a review of government regulation when we find rule that put a unnecessary burden on business we will fix them but i will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguard to protect the american people that's what we've do in this country for much than a century it's why our food be safe to eat our water be safe to drink and our air be safe to breathe it's why we have speed limit and child labor law it's why last year we put in place consumer protection against hide fee and penalty by credit card company and new rule to prevent another financial crisis and it's why we pass reform that finally prevent the health insurance industry from exploit patient now i've hear rumor that a few of you have some concern about the new health care law so let me be the first to say that anything can be improve if you have idea about how to improve this law by make care good or much affordable i be eager to work with you we can start right now by correct a flaw in the legislation that have place a unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small business what i'm not will to do be go back to the day when insurance company can deny someone coverage because of a pre exist condition i'm not will to tell james howard a brain cancer patient from texas that his treatment may not be cover i'm not will to tell jim houser a small business owner from oregon that he have to go back to pay much to cover his employee as we speak this law be make prescription drug cheap for senior and give uninsured student a chance to stay on their parent coverage so instead of re fight the battle of the last two year let's fix what need fix and move forward now the final step a critical step in win the future be to make sure we aren't bury under a mountain of debt we be live with a legacy of deficit spend that begin almost a decade ago and in the wake of the financial crisis some of that be necessary to keep credit flow save job and put money in people's pocket but now that the bad of the recession be over we have to confront the fact that our government spend much than it take in that be not sustainable every day family sacrifice to live within their mean they deserve a government that do the same so tonight i be propose that start this year we freeze annual domestic spend for the next five year this would reduce the deficit by much than billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spend to the low share of our economy since dwight eisenhower be president this freeze will require painful cut already we have freeze the salary of hardworking federal employee for the next two year i've propose cut to thing i care deeply about like community action program the secretary of defense have also agree to cut ten of billion of dollar in spend that he and his general believe our military can do without i recognize that some in this chamber have already propose deep cut and i'm will to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without but let's make sure that we're not do it on the back of our much vulnerable citizen and let's make sure what we're cut be really excess weight cut the deficit by gut our investment in innovation and education be like lighten a overload airplane by remove its engine it may feel like you're fly high at first but it won't take long before you'll feel the impact now much of the cut and saving i've propose only address annual domestic spend which represent a little much than of our budget to make far progress we have to stop pretend that cut this kind of spend alone will be enough it won't the bipartisan fiscal commission i create last year make this crystal clear i don't agree with all their proposal but they make important progress and their conclusion be that the only way to tackle our deficit be to cut excessive spend wherever we find it in domestic spend defense spend health care spend and spend through tax break and loophole this mean far reduce health care cost include program like medicare and medicaid which be the single big contributor to our long term deficit health insurance reform will slow this rise cost which be part of why nonpartisan economist have say that repeal the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollar to our deficit still i'm will to look at other idea to bring down cost include one that republican suggest last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuit to put us on solid grind we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen social security for future generation and we must do it without putting at risk current retiree the much vulnerable or people with disability without slash benefit for future generation and without subject american guarantee retirement income to the whim of the stock market and if we truly care about our deficit we simply cannot afford a permanent extension of the tax cut for the wealthy of american before we take money away from our school or scholarship away from our student we should ask millionaire to give up their tax break it's not a matter of punish their success it's about promote america's success in fact the good thing we can do on tax for all american be to simplify the individual tax code this will be a tough job but member of both party have express interest in do this and i be prepare to join them so now be the time to act now be the time for both side and both house of congress democrat and republican to forge a principled compromise that get the job do if we make the hard choice now to rein in our deficit we can make the investment we need to win the future let me take this one step far we shouldn't just give our people a government that's much affordable we should give them a government that's much competent and efficient we cannot win the future with a government of the past we live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the government happen in the age of black and white tv there be twelve different agency that deal with export there be at less five different entity that deal with house policy then there's my favorite example the interior department be in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water but the commerce department handle them in when they're in saltwater and i hear it get even much complicate once they're smoke now we have make great stride over the last two year in use technology and get rid of waste veteran can now download their electronic medical record with a click of the mouse we're sell acre of federal office space that hasn't be use in year and we will cut through red tape to get rid of much but we need to think big in the come month my administration will develop a proposal to merge consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that good serve the goal of a much competitive america i will submit that proposal to congress for a vote and we will push to get it pass in the come year we will also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of government because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollar be be spend you will be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history because you deserve to know when your elect official be meet with lobbyist i ask congress to do what the white house have already do put that information online and because the american people deserve to know that special interest aren't lard up legislation with pet project both party in congress should know this if a bill come to my desk with earmark inside i will veto it a 21st century government that's open and competent a government that life within its mean a economy that's drive by new skill and idea our success in this new and change world will require reform responsibility and innovation it will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affair just as job and business can now race across border so can new threat and new challenge no single wall separate east and west no one rival superpower be align against us and so we must defeat determine enemy wherever they be and build coalition that cut across line of region and race and religion america's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom justice and dignity and because we have begin this work tonight we can say that american leadership have be renew and america's stand have be restore look to iraq where nearly of our brave man and woman have leave with their head hold high where american combat patrol have end violence have come down and a new government have be form this year our civilian will forge a last partnership with the iraqi people while we finish the job of bring our troop out of iraq america's commitment have be keep the iraq war be come to a end of course as we speak al qaeda and their affiliate continue to plan attack against us thank to our intelligence and law enforcement professional we be disrupt plot and secure our city and sky and as extremist try to inspire act of violence within our border we be respond with the strength of our community with respect for the rule of law and with the conviction that american muslim be a part of our american family we have also take the fight to al qaeda and their ally abroad in afghanistan our troop have take taliban stronghold and train afghan security force our purpose be clear by prevent the taliban from reestablish a stranglehold over the afghan people we will deny al qaeda the safe haven that serve as a launch pad for thank to our heroic troop and civilian few afghan be under the control of the insurgency there will be tough fight ahead and the afghan government will need to deliver good governance but we be strengthen the capacity of the afghan people and build a endure partnership with them this year we will work with nearly country to begin a transition to a afghan lead and this july we will begin to bring our troop home in pakistan al qaeda's leadership be under much pressure than at any point since their leader and operative be be remove from the battlefield their safe haven be shrink and we have send a message from the afghan border to the arabian peninsula to all part of the globe we will not relend we will not waver and we will defeat you american leadership can also be see in the effort to secure the bad weapon of war because republican and democrat approve the new start treaty far few nuclear weapon and launcher will be deploy because we rally the world nuclear material be be lock down on every continent so they never fall into the hand of terrorist because of a diplomatic effort to insist that iran meet its obligation the iranian government now face tough and tight sanction than ever before and on the korean peninsula we stand with our ally south korea and insist that north korea keep its commitment to abandon nuclear weapon this be just a part of how we be shape a world that favor peace and prosperity with our european ally we revitalize nato and increase our cooperation on everything from counter terrorism to missile defense we have reset our relationship with russia strengthen asian alliance and build new partnership with nation like india this march i will travel to brazil chile and el salvador to forge new alliance for progress in the americas around the globe we be stand with that who take responsibility help farmer grow much food support doctor who care for the sick and combat the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity recent event have show us that what set us apart must not just be our power it must be the purpose behind it in south sudan with our assistance the people be finally able to vote for independence after year of war thousand line up before dawn people dance in the street one man who lose four of his brother at war sum up the scene around him this be a battlefield for much of my life now we want to be free we see that same desire to be free in tunisia where the will of the people prove much powerful than the writ of a dictator and tonight let us be clear the unite state of america stand with the people of tunisia and support the democratic aspiration of all people we must never forget that the thing we've struggle for and fight for live in the heart of people everywhere and we must always remember that the american who have bear the great burden in this struggle be the man and woman who serve our country tonight let us speak with one voice in reaffirm that our nation be unite in support of our troop and their family let us serve them as good as they have serve us by give them the equipment they need by provide them with the care and benefit they have earn and by enlist our veteran in the great task of build our own nation our troop come from every corner of this country they be black white latino asian and native american they be christian and hindu jewish and muslim and yes we know that some of them be gay start this year no american will be forbid from serve the country they love because of who they love and with that change i call on all of our college campus to open their door to our military recruiter and the rotc it be time to leave behind the divisive battle of the past it be time to move forward as one nation we should have no illusion about the work ahead of us reform our school change the way we use energy reduce our deficit none of this be easy all of it will take time and it will be hard because we will argue about everything the cost the detail the letter of every law of course some country don't have this problem if the central government want a railroad they get a railroad no matter how many home be bulldoze if they don't want a bad story in the newspaper it doesn't get write and yet as contentious and frustrate and messy as our democracy can sometimes be i know there isn't a person here who would trade place with any other nation on earth we may have difference in policy but we all believe in the right enshrine in our constitution we may have different opinion but we believe in the same promise that say this be a place where you can make it if you try we may have different background but we believe in the same dream that say this be a country where anything's possible no matter who you be no matter where you come from that dream be why i can stand here before you tonight that dream be why a work class kid from scranton can stand behind me that dream be why someone who begin by sweep the floor of his father's cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the house in the great nation on earth that dream that american dream be what drive the allen brother to reinvent their roof company for a new era it's what drive that student at forsyth tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future and that dream be the story of a small business owner name brandon fisher brandon start a company in berlin pennsylvania that specialize in a new kind of drill technology one day last summer he see the news that halfway across the world man be trap in a chilean mine and no one know how to save them but brandon think his company can help and so he design a rescue that would come to be know as plan b his employee work around the clock to manufacture the necessary drill equipment and brandon leave for chile along with other he begin drill a foot hole into the grind work three or four day at a time with no sleep thirty seven day late plan b succeed and the miner be rescue but because he didn't want all of the attention brandon wasn't there when the miner emerge he have already go home back to work on his next project late one of his employee say of the rescue we prove that center rock be a little company but we do big thing we do big thing from the early day of our found america have be the story of ordinary people who dare to dream that's how we win the future we be a nation that say i may not have a lot of money but i have this great idea for a new company i may not come from a family of college graduate but i will be the first to get my degree i may not know that people in trouble but i think i can help them and i need to try i'm not sure how we'll reach that good place beyond the horizon but i know we'll get there i know we will we do big thing the idea of america endure our destiny remain our choice and tonight much than two century late it be because of our people that our future be hopeful our journey go forward and the state of our union be strong thank you god bless you and may god bless the unite state of america mr speaker mr vice president member of congress distinguish guest and fellow american last month i go to andrews air force base and welcome home some of our last troop to serve in iraq together we offer a final proud salute to the color under which much than a million of our fellow citizen fight and several thousand give their life we gather tonight know that this generation of hero have make the unite state safe and much respect around the world for the first time in nine year there be no american fight in iraq for the first time in two decade osama bin lade be not a threat to this country much of al qaeda's top lieutenant have be defeat the taliban's momentum have be break and some troop in afghanistan have begin to come home this achievement be a testament to the courage selflessness and teamwork of america's arm force at a time when too many of our institution have let us down they exceed all expectation they're not consume with personal ambition they don't obsess over their difference they focus on the mission at hand they work together imagine what we can accomplish if we follow their example think about the america within our reach a country that lead the world in educate its people a america that attract a new generation of high tech manufacture and high pay job a future where we're in control of our own energy and our security and prosperity aren't so tie to unstable part of the world a economy build to last where hard work pay off and responsibility be reward we can do this i know we can because we've do it before at the end of world war ii when another generation of hero return home from combat they build the strong economy and middle class the world have ever know my grandfather a veteran of patton's army get the chance to go to college on the gi bill my grandmother who work on a bomber assembly line be part of a workforce that turn out the good product on earth the two of them share the optimism of a nation that have triumph over a depression and fascism they understand they be part of something large that they be contribute to a story of success that every american have a chance to share the basic american promise that if you work hard you can do good enough to raise a family own a home send your kid to college and put a little away for retirement the define issue of our time be how to keep that promise alive no challenge be much urgent no debate be much important we can either settle for a country where a shrink numb of people do really good while a grow numb of american barely get by or we can restore a economy where everyone get a fair shoot and everyone do their fair share and everyone play by the same set of rule what's at stake aren't democratic value or republican value but american value and we have to reclaim them let's remember how we get here long before the recession job and manufacture begin leave our shore technology make business much efficient but also make some job obsolete folk at the top see their income rise like never before but much hardworking american struggle with cost that be grow paycheck that weren't and personal debt that keep pile up in the house of card collapse we learn that mortgage have be sell to people who couldn't afford or understand them bank have make huge bet and bonus with other people's money regulator have look the other way or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior it be wrong it be irresponsible and it plunge our economy into a crisis that put million out of work saddle us with much debt and leave innocent hardworking american hold the bag in the six month before i take office we lose nearly million job and we lose another million before our policy be in full effect that be the fact but so be this in the last month business have create much than million job last year they create the much job since american manufacturer be hire again create job for the first time since the late 1990s together we've agree to cut the deficit by much than trillion and we've put in place new rule to hold wall street accountable so a crisis like this never happen again the state of our union be get strong and we've come too far to turn back now as long as i'm president i will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum but i intend to fight obstruction with action and i will oppose any effort to return to the very same policy that bring on this economic crisis in the first place no we will not go back to a economy weaken by outsource bad debt and phony financial profit tonight i want to speak about how we move forward and lie out a blueprint for a economy that's build to last a economy build on american manufacture american energy skill for american worker and a renewal of american value now this blueprint begin with american manufacture on the day i take office our auto industry be on the verge of collapse some even say we should let it die with a million job at stake i refuse to let that happen in exchange for help we demand responsibility we get worker and automaker to settle their difference we get the industry to retool and restructure today general motor be back on top as the world's numb one automaker chrysler have grow fast in the u.s than any major car company ford be invest billion in u.s plant and factory and together the entire industry add nearly job we bet on american worker we bet on american ingenuity and tonight the american auto industry be back what's happen in detroit can happen in other industry it can happen in cleveland and pittsburgh and raleigh we can't bring every job back that's leave our shore but right now it's get much expensive to do business in place like china meanwhile america be much productive a few week ago the ceo of master lock tell me that it now make business sense for him to bring job back home today for the first time in year master lock's unionize plant in milwaukee be run at full capacity so we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacture back but we have to seize it tonight my message to business leader be simple ask yourself what you can do to bring job back to your country and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed we should start with our tax code right now company get tax break for move job and profit overseas meanwhile company that choose to stay in america get hit with one of the high tax rate in the world it make no sense and everyone know it so let's change it first if you're a business that want to outsource job you shouldn't get a tax deduction for do it that money should be use to cover move expense for company like master lock that decide to bring job home 2 no american company should be able to avoid pay its fair share of tax by move job and profit overseas from now on every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax and every penny should go towards lower tax for company that choose to stay here and hire here in america 3 if you're a american manufacturer you should get a big tax cut if you're a high tech manufacturer we should double the tax deduction you get for make your product here and if you want to relocate in a community that be hit hard when a factory leave town you should get help finance a new plant equipment or train for new worker so my message be simple it be time to stop reward business that ship job overseas and start reward company that create job right here in america send me this tax reform and i will sign them right away we're also make it easy for american business to sell product all over the world two year ago i set a goal of double u.s export over five year with the bipartisan trade agreement we sign into law we're on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule and soon there will be million of new customer for american good in panama colombia and south korea soon there will be new car on the street of seoul import from detroit and toledo and chicago i will go anywhere in the world to open new market for american product and i will not stand by when our competitor don't play by the rule we've bring trade case against china at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and it's make a difference over a thousand american be work today because we stop a surge in chinese tire but we need to do much it's not right when another country let our movie music and software be pirate it's not fair when foreign manufacturer have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidize tonight i'm announce the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charge with investigate unfair trade practice in country like china there will be much inspection to prevent counterfeit or unsafe good from cross our border and this congress should make sure that no foreign company have a advantage over american manufacture when it come to access finance or new market like russia our worker be the much productive on earth and if the play field be level i promise you america will always win i also hear from many business leader who want to hire in the unite state but can't find worker with the right skill grow industry in science and technology have twice as many opening as we have worker who can do the job think about that opening at a time when million of american be look for work it's inexcusable and we know how to fix it jackie bray be a single mom from north carolina who be lay off from her job as a mechanic then siemens open a gas turbine factory in charlotte and form a partnership with central piedmont community college the company help the college design course in laser and robotic train it pay jackie's tuition then hire her to help operate their plant i want every american look for work to have the same opportunity as jackie do join me in a national commitment to train million american with skill that will lead directly to a job my administration have already line up much company that want to help model partnership between business like siemens and community college in place like charlotte and orlando and louisville be up and run now you need to give much community college the resource they need to become community career center place that teach people skill that business be look for right now from datum management to high tech manufacture and i want to cut through the maze of confuse train program so that from now on people like jackie have one program one website and one place to go for all the information and help that they need it be time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that put people to work this reform will help people get job that be open today but to prepare for the job of tomorrow our commitment to skill and education have to start early for little than percent of what our nation spend on education each year we've convince nearly every state in the country to raise their standard for teach and learn the first time that's happen in a generation but challenge remain and we know how to solve them at a time when other country be double down on education tight budget have force state to lie off thousand of teacher we know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over a great teacher can offer a escape from poverty to the child who dream beyond his circumstance every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who change the trajectory of their life much teacher work tirelessly with modest pay sometimes dig into their own pocket for school supply just to make a difference teacher matter so instead of bash them or defend the status quo let's offer school a deal give them the resource to keep good teacher on the job and reward the good one and in return grant school flexibility to teach with creativity and passion to stop teach to the test and to replace teacher who just aren't help kid learn that's a bargain worth make we also know that when student don't walk away from their education much of them walk the stage to get their diploma when student be not allow to drop out they do good so tonight i be propose that every state every state require that all student stay in high school until they graduate or turn when kid do graduate the much daunt challenge can be the cost of college at a time when american owe much in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress need to stop the interest rate on student loan from double in july extend the tuition tax credit we start that save million of middle class family thousand of dollar and give much young people the chance to earn their way through college by double the numb of work study job in the next five year of course it's not enough for us to increase student aid we can't just keep subsidize skyrocket tuition we'll run out of money state also need to do their part by make high education a high priority in their budget and college and university have to do their part by work to keep cost down recently i speak with a group of college president who've do just that some school redesign course to help student finish much quickly some use good technology the point be it's possible so let me put college and university on notice if you can't stop tuition from go up the fund you get from taxpayer will go down high education can't be a luxury it be a economic imperative that every family in america should be able to afford let's also remember that hundred of thousand of talented hardworking student in this country face another challenge the fact that they aren't yet american citizen many be bring here as small child be american through and through yet they live every day with the threat of deportation other come much recently to study business and science and engineer but as soon as they get their degree we send them home to invent new product and create new job somewhere else that doesn't make sense i believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration that's why my administration have put much boot on the border than ever before that's why there be few illegal crossing than when i take office the opponent of action be out of excuse we should be work on comprehensive immigration reform right now but if election year politic keep congress from act on a comprehensive plan let's at less agree to stop expel responsible young people who want to staff our lab start new business defend this country send me a law that give them the chance to earn their citizenship i will sign it right away you see a economy build to last be one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country that mean woman should earn equal pay for equal work it mean we should support everyone who's will to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspire to become the next steve job after all innovation be what america have always be about much new job be create in start up and small business so let's pass a agendum that help them succeed tear down regulation that prevent aspire entrepreneur from get the finance to grow expand tax relief to small business that be raise wage and create good job both party agree on this idea so put them in a bill and get it on my desk this year innovation also demand basic research today the discovery take place in our federally finance lab and university can lead to new treatment that kill cancer cell but leave healthy one untouched new lightweight vest for cop and soldier that can stop any bullet don't gut this investment in our budget don't let other country win the race for the future support the same kind of research and innovation that lead to the computer chip and the internet to new american job and new american industry and nowhere be the promise of innovation great than in american make energy over the last three year we've open million of new acre for oil and gas exploration and tonight i'm direct my administration to open much than percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resource right now right now american oil production be the high that it's be in eight year that's right eight year not only that last year we rely little on foreign oil than in any of the past year but with only percent of the world's oil reserve oil isn't enough this country need a all out all of the above strategy that develop every available source of american energy a strategy that's clean cheap and full of new job we have a supply of natural gas that can last america nearly year and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy expert believe this will support much than job by the end of the decade and i'm require all company that drill for gas on public land to disclose the chemical they use because america will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizen at risk the development of natural gas will create job and power truck and factory that be clean and cheap prove that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy and by the way it be public research dollar over the course of year that help develop the technology to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock remind us that government support be critical in help business get new energy idea off the grind now what's true for natural gas be just as true for clean energy in three year our partnership with the private sector have already position america to be the world's lead manufacturer of high tech battery because of federal investment renewable energy use have nearly double and thousand of american have job because of it when bryan ritterby be lay off from his job make furniture he say he worry that at no one would give him a 2 chance but he find work at energetx a wind turbine manufacturer in michigan before the recession the factory only make luxury yacht today it's hire worker like bryan who say i'm proud to be work in the industry of the future our experience with shale gas our experience with natural gas show us that the payoff on this public investment don't always come right away some technology don't pan out some company fail but i will not walk away from the promise of clean energy i will not walk away from worker like bryan i will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to china or germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here we've subsidize oil company for a century that's long enough it's time to end the taxpayer giveaway to a industry that rarely have be much profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never have be much promise pass clean energy tax credit create this job we can also spur energy innovation with new incentive the difference in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change but there's no reason why congress shouldn't at less set a clean energy standard that create a market for innovation so far you haven't act good tonight i will i'm direct my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power million home and i'm proud to announce that the department of defense work with us the world's large consumer of energy will make one of the large commitment to clean energy in history with the navy purchase enough capacity to power a quarter of a million home a year of course the easy way to save money be to waste little energy so here's a proposal help manufacturer eliminate energy waste in their factory and give business incentive to upgrade their building their energy bill will be billion low over the next decade and america will have little pollution much manufacture much job for construction worker who need them send me a bill that create this job build this new energy future should be just one part of a broad agendum to repair america's infrastructure so much of america need to be rebuild we've get crumble road and bridge a power grid that waste too much energy a incomplete high speed broadband network that prevent a small business owner in rural america from sell her product all over the world during the great depression america build the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge after world war ii we connect our state with a system of highway democratic and republican administration invest in great project that benefit everybody from the worker who build them to the business that still use them today in the next few week i will sign a executive order clear away the red tape that slow down too many construction project but you need to fund this project take the money we're no long spend at war use half of it to pay down our debt and use the rest to do some nation build right here at home there's never be a good time to build especially since the construction industry be one of the hard hit when the house bubble burst of course construction worker weren't the only one who be hurt so be million of innocent american who've see their home value decline and while government can't fix the problem on its own responsible homeowner shouldn't have to sit and wait for the house market to hit bottom to get some relief and that's why i'm send this congress a plan that give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about a year on their mortgage by refinance at historically low rate no much red tape no much runaround from the bank a small fee on the large financial institution will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give that bank that be rescue by taxpayer a chance to repay a deficit of trust let's never forget million of american who work hard and play by the rule every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same it's time to apply the same rule from top to bottom no bailout no handout and no copouts a america build to last insist on responsibility from everybody we've all pay the price for lender who sell mortgage to people who couldn't afford them and buyer who know they couldn't afford them that's why we need smart regulation to prevent irresponsible behavior rule to prevent financial fraud or toxic dump or faulty medical device this don't destroy the free market they make the free market work good there's no question that some regulation be outdate unnecessary or too costly in fact i've approve few regulation in the first three year of my presidency than my republican predecessor do in his i've order every federal agency to eliminate rule that don't make sense we've already announce over reform and just a fraction of them will save business and citizen much than billion over the next five year we get rid of one rule from year ago that can have force some dairy farmer to spend a year prove that they can contain a spill because milk be somehow classify as a oil with a rule like that i guess it be worth cry over spill milk laughter and applause now i'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency look over his shoulder absolutely but i will not back down from make sure a oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we see in the gulf two year ago i will not back down from protect our kid from mercury poison or make sure that our food be safe and our water be clean i will not go back to the day when health insurance company have unchecked power to cancel your policy deny your coverage or charge woman differently than man and i will not go back to the day when wall street be allow to play by its own set of rule the new rule we pass restore what should be any financial system's core purpose get fund to entrepreneur with the good idea and get loan to responsible family who want to buy a home or start a business or send their kid to college so if you be a big bank or financial institution you're no long allow to make risky bet with your customer deposit you're require to write out a live will that detail exactly how you'll pay the bill if you fail because the rest of us be not bail you out ever again and if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company the day of sign people up for product they can't afford with confuse form and deceptive practice that day be over today american consumer finally have a watchdog in richard cordray with one job to look out for them we'll also establish a financial crime unit of highly train investigator to crack down on large scale fraud and protect people's investment some financial firm violate major anti fraud law because there's no real penalty for be a repeat offender that's bad for consumer and it's bad for the vast majority of banker and financial service professional who do the right thing so pass legislation that make the penalty for fraud count and tonight i'm ask my attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutor and lead state attorney general to expand our investigation into the abusive lend and package of risky mortgage that lead to the house crisis this new unit will hold accountable that who break the law speed assistance to homeowner and help turn the page on a era of recklessness that hurt so many american now a return to the american value of fair play and share responsibility will help protect our people and our economy but it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future right now our much immediate priority be stop a tax hike on million work american while the recovery be still fragile people cannot afford lose out of each paycheck this year there be plenty of way to get this do so let's agree right here right now no side issue no drama pass the payroll tax cut without delay let's get it do when it come to the deficit we've already agree to much than trillion in cut and saving but we need to do much and that mean make choice right now we're poise to spend nearly trillion much on what be suppose to be a temporary tax break for the wealthy percent of american right now because of loophole and shelter in the tax code a quarter of all millionaire pay low tax rate than million of middle class household right now warren buffett pay a low tax rate than his secretary do we want to keep this tax cut for the wealthy american or do we want to keep our investment in everything else like education and medical research a strong military and care for our veteran because if we're serious about pay down our debt we can't do both the american people know what the right choice be so do i as i tell the speaker this summer i'm prepare to make much reform that rein in the long term cost of medicare and medicaid and strengthen social security so long as that program remain a guarantee of security for senior but in return we need to change our tax code so that people like me and a awful lot of member of congress pay our fair share of tax tax reform should follow the buffett rule if you make much than million a year you should not pay little than percent in tax and my republican friend tom coburn be right washington should stop subsidize millionaire in fact if you're earn a million dollar a year you shouldn't get special tax subsidy or deduction on the other hand if you make under a year like percent of american family your tax shouldn't go up you're the one struggle with rise cost and stagnant wage you're the one who need relief now you can call this class warfare all you want but ask a billionaire to pay at less as much as his secretary in tax much american would call that common sense we don't begrudge financial success in this country we admire it when american talk about folk like me pay my fair share of tax it's not because they envy the rich it's because they understand that when i get a tax break i don't need and the country can't afford it either add to the deficit or somebody else have to make up the difference like a senior on a fix income or a student try to get through school or a family try to make end meet that's not right american know that's not right they know that this generation's success be only possible because past generation feel a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of share responsibility that's how we'll reduce our deficit that's a america build to last now i recognize that people watch tonight have differ view about tax and debt energy and health care but no matter what party they belong to i bet much american be think the same thing right about now nothing will get do in washington this year or next year or maybe even the year after that because washington be break can you blame them for feel a little cynical the great blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't come from event beyond our control it come from a debate in washington over whether the unite state would pay its bill or not who benefit from that fiasco i've talk tonight about the deficit of trust between main street and wall street but the divide between this city and the rest of the country be at less as bad and it seem to get bad every year some of this have to do with the corrosive influence of money in politic so together let's take some step to fix that send me a bill that ban insider trade by member of congress i will sign it tomorrow let's limit any elect official from own stock in industry they impact let's make sure people who bundle campaign contribution for congress can't lobby congress and vice versa a idea that have bipartisan support at less outside of washington some of what's break have to do with the way congress do its business this day a simple majority be no long enough to get anything even routine business pass through the senate neither party have be blameless in this tactic now both party should put a end to it for starter i ask the senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nomination receive a simple up or down vote within day the executive branch also need to change too often it's inefficient outdate and remote that's why i've ask this congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our government be lean quick and much responsive to the need of the american people finally none of this can happen unless we also low the temperature in this town we need to end the notion that the two party must be lock in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politic be about cling to rigid ideology instead of build consensus around common sense idea i'm a democrat but i believe what republican abraham lincoln believe that government should do for people only what they cannot do good by themselves and no much that's why my education reform offer much competition and much control for school and state that's why we're get rid of regulation that don't work that's why our health care law rely on a reform private market not a government program on the other hand even my republican friend who complain the much about government spend have support federally finance road and clean energy project and federal office for the folk back home the point be we should all want a smart much effective government and while we may not be able to bridge our big philosophical difference this year we can make real progress with or without this congress i will keep take action that help the economy grow but i can do a whole lot much with your help because when we act together there's nothing the unite state of america can't achieve that's the lesson we've learn from our action abroad over the last few year end the iraq war have allow us to strike decisive blow against our enemy from pakistan to yemen the al qaeda operative who remain be scramble know that they can't escape the reach of the unite state of america from this position of strength we've begin to wind down the war in afghanistan ten thousand of our troop have come home twenty three thousand much will leave by the end of this summer this transition to afghan lead will continue and we will build a endure partnership with afghanistan so that it be never again a source of attack against america as the tide of war recede a wave of change have wash across the middle east and north africa from tunis to cairo from sana'a to tripoli a year ago qaddafi be one of the world's long serve dictator a murderer with american blood on his hand today he be go and in syria i have no doubt that the assad regime will soon discover that the force of change cannot be reverse and that human dignity cannot be deny how this incredible transformation will end remain uncertain but we have a huge stake in the outcome and while it's ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate we will advocate for that value that have serve our own country so good we will stand against violence and intimidation we will stand for the right and dignity of all human being man and woman christian muslim and jew we will support policy that lead to strong and stable democracy and open market because tyranny be no match for liberty and we will safeguard america's own security against that who threaten our citizen our friend and our interest look at iran through the power of our diplomacy a world that be once divide about how to deal with iran's nuclear program now stand as one the regime be much isolate than ever before its leader be face with cripple sanction and as long as they shirk their responsibility this pressure will not relend let there be no doubt america be determine to prevent iran from get a nuclear weapon and i will take no option off the table to achieve that goal but a peaceful resolution of this issue be still possible and far good and if iran change course and meet its obligation it can rejoin the community of nation the renewal of american leadership can be feel across the globe our old alliance in europe and asia be strong than ever our tie to the americas be deep our ironclad commitment and i mean ironclad to israel's security have mean the close military cooperation between our two country in history we've make it clear that america be a pacific power and a new begin in burma have light a new hope from the coalition we've build to secure nuclear material to the mission we've lead against hunger and disease from the blow we've deal to our enemy to the endure power of our moral example america be back anyone who tell you otherwise anyone who tell you that america be in decline or that our influence have wane doesn't know what they're talk about that's not the message we get from leader around the world who be eager to work with us that's not how people feel from tokyo to berlin from cape town to rio where opinion of america be high than they've be in year yes the world be change no we can't control every event but america remain the one indispensable nation in world affair and as long as i'm president i intend to keep it that way that's why work with our military leader i've propose a new defense strategy that ensure we maintain the fine military in the world while save nearly half a trillion dollar in our budget to stay one step ahead of our adversary i've already send this congress legislation that will secure our country from the grow danger of cyber threat above all our freedom endure because of the man and woman in uniform who defend it as they come home we must serve them as good as they've serve us that include give them the care and the benefit they have earn which be why we've increase annual va spend every year i've be president and it mean enlist our veteran in the work of rebuild our nation with the bipartisan support of this congress we're provide new tax credit to company that hire vet michelle and jill biden have work with american business to secure a pledge of job for veteran and their family and tonight i'm propose a veteran job corp that will help our community hire veteran as cop and firefighter so that america be as strong as that who defend her which bring me back to where i begin that of us who've be send here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troop when you put on that uniform it doesn't matter if you're black or white asian latino native american conservative liberal rich poor gay straight when you're march into battle you look out for the person next to you or the mission fail when you're in the thick of the fight you rise or fall as one unit serve one nation leave no one behind one of my proud possession be the flag that the seal team take with them on the mission to get bin lade on it be each of their name some may be democrat some may be republican but that doesn't matter just like it didn't matter that day in the situation room when i sit next to bob gate a man who be george bush's defense secretary and hillary clinton a woman who run against me for president all that matter that day be the mission no one think about politic no one think about themselves one of the young man involve in the raid late tell me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission it only succeed he say because every single member of that unit do their job the pilot who land the helicopter that spin out of control the translator who keep other from enter the compound the troop who separate the woman and child from the fight the seal who charge up the stair much than that the mission only succeed because every member of that unit trust each other because you can't charge up that stair into darkness and danger unless you know that there's somebody behind you watch your back so it be with america each time i look at that flag i'm remind that our destiny be stitch together like that star and that stripe no one build this country on their own this nation be great because we build it together this nation be great because we work as a team this nation be great because we get each other's back and if we hold fast to that truth in this moment of trial there be no challenge too great no mission too hard as long as we be join in common purpose as long as we maintain our common resolve our journey move forward and our future be hopeful and the state of our union will always be strong thank you god bless you and god bless the unite state of america mr speaker mr vice president member of congress fellow citizen fifty one year ago john f kennedy declare to this chamber that the constitution make us not rival for power but partner for progress it be my task he say to report the state of the union to improve it be the task of us all tonight thank to the grit and determination of the american people there be much progress to report after a decade of grind war our brave man and woman in uniform be come home after year of grueling recession our business have create over six million new job we buy much american car than we have in five year and little foreign oil than we have in our house market be heal our stock market be rebound and consumer patient and homeowner enjoy strong protection than ever before so together we have clear away the rubble of crisis and we can say with renew confidence that the state of our union be strong but we gather here know that there be million of american whose hard work and dedication have not yet be reward our economy be add job but too many people still can't find full time employment corporate profit have skyrocket to all time high but for much than a decade wage and income have barely budge it be our generation's task then to reignite the true engine of america's economic growth a rise thrive middle class it be our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that build this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibility you can get ahead no matter where you come from no matter what you look like or who you love it be our unfinished task to make sure that this government work on behalf of the many and not just the few that it encourage free enterprise reward individual initiative and open the door of opportunity to every child across this great nation the american people don't expect government to solve every problem they don't expect that of us in this chamber to agree on every issue but they do expect us to put the nation's interest before party they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can for they know that america move forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improve this union remain the task of us all our work must begin by make some basic decision about our budget decision that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery over the last few year both party have work together to reduce the deficit by much than trillion mostly through spend cut but also by raise tax rate on the wealthy percent of american as a result we be much than halfway towards the goal of trillion in deficit reduction that economist say we need to stabilize our finance now we need to finish the job and the question be how in congress pass a law say that if both party couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollar worth of budget cut would automatically go into effect this year this sudden harsh arbitrary cut would jeopardize our military readiness they'd devastate priority like education and energy and medical research they would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundred of thousand of job that's why democrat republican business leader and economist have already say that this cut know here in washington as the sequester be a really bad idea now some in congress have propose prevent only the defense cut by make even big cut to thing like education and job train medicare and social security benefit that idea be even bad yes the big driver of our long term debt be the rise cost of health care for a age population and that of us who care deeply about program like medicare must embrace the need for modest reform otherwise our retirement program will crowd out the investment we need for our child and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generation but we can't ask senior citizen and work family to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while ask nothing much from the wealthy and the much powerful we won't grow the middle class simply by shift the cost of health care or college onto family that be already struggle or by force community to lie off much teacher and much cop and much firefighter much american democrat republican and independent understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity they know that broad base economic growth require a balance approach to deficit reduction with spend cut and revenue and with everybody do their fair share and that's the approach i offer tonight on medicare i'm prepare to enact reform that will achieve the same amount of health care saving by the begin of the next decade as the reform propose by the bipartisan simpson bowles commission already the affordable care act be help to slow the growth of health care cost and the reform i'm propose go even far we'll reduce taxpayer subsidy to prescription drug company and ask much from the wealthy senior we'll bring down cost by change the way our government pay for medicare because our medical bill shouldn't be base on the numb of test order or day spend in the hospital they should be base on the quality of care that our senior receive and i be open to additional reform from both party so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement our government shouldn't make promise we cannot keep but we must keep the promise we've already make to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leader in both party have already suggest and save hundred of billion of dollar by get rid of tax loophole and deduction for the good off and the good connect after all why would we choose to make deep cut to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax break how be that fair why be it that deficit reduction be a big emergency justify make cut in social security benefit but not close some loophole how do that promote growth now be our good chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourage job creation and help bring down the deficit we can get this do the american people deserve a tax code that help small business spend little time fill out complicate form and much time expand and hire a tax code that ensure billionaires with high power accountant can't work the system and pay a low rate than their hardworking secretary a tax code that lower incentive to move job overseas and lower tax rate for business and manufacturer that be create job right here in the unite state of america that's what tax reform can deliver that's what we can do together i realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy the politic will be hard for both side none of us will get percent of what we want but the alternative will cost us job hurt our economy visit hardship on million of hardworking american so let's set party interest aside and work to pass a budget that replace reckless cut with smart saving and wise investment in our future and let's do it without the brinksmanship that stress consumer and scare off investor the great nation on earth cannot keep conduct its business by drift from one manufacture crisis to the next we can't do it let's agree right here right now to keep the people's government open and pay our bill on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the unite state of america the american people have work too hard for too long rebuild from one crisis to see their elect official cause another now much of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agendum but let's be clear deficit reduction alone be not a economic plan a grow economy that create good middle class job that must be the north star that guide our effort every day we should ask ourselves three question as a nation how do we attract much job to our shore how do we equip our people with the skill they need to get that job and how do we make sure that hard work lead to a decent live a year and a half ago i put forward a american job act that independent economist say would create much than million new job and i thank the last congress for pass some of that agendum i urge this congress to pass the rest but tonight i'll lie out additional proposal that be fully pay for and fully consistent with the budget framework both party agree to just month ago let me repeat nothing i'm propose tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime it be not a big government we need but a smart government that set priority and invest in broad base growth that's what we should be look for our first priority be make america a magnet for new job and manufacture after shed job for much than year our manufacturer have add about job over the past three caterpillar be bring job back from japan ford be bring job back from mexico and this year apple will start make mac in america again there be thing we can do right now to accelerate this trend last year we create our first manufacture innovation institute in youngstown ohio a once shutter warehouse be now a state of the art lab where new worker be master the 3d print that have the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything there's no reason this can't happen in other town so tonight i'm announce the launch of three much of this manufacture hub where business will partner with the department of defense and energy to turn region leave behind by globalization into global center of high tech job and i ask this congress to help create a network of of this hub and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacture be make right here in america we can get that do now if we want to make the good product we also have to invest in the good idea every dollar we invest to map the human genome return to our economy every dollar today our scientist be map the human brain to unlock the answer to alzheimer's they're develop drug to regenerate damage organ devise new material to make battery time much powerful now be not the time to gut this job create investment in science and innovation now be the time to reach a level of research and development not see since the height of the space race we need to make that investment today no area hold much promise than our investment in american energy after year of talk about it we're finally poise to control our own energy future we produce much oil at home than we have in year we have double the distance our car will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from source like wind and solar with ten of thousand of good american job to show for it we produce much natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone's energy bill be low because of it and over the last four year our emission of the dangerous carbon pollution that threaten our planet have actually fall but for the sake of our child and our future we must do much to combat climate change now it's true that no single event make a trend but the fact be the hot year on record have all come in the last heat wave drought wildfire flood all be now much frequent and much intense we can choose to believe that superstorm sandy and the much severe drought in decade and the bad wildfire some state have ever see be all just a freak coincidence or we can choose to believe in the overwhelm judgment of science and act before it's too late now the good news be we can make meaningful progress on this issue while drive strong economic growth i urge this congress to get together pursue a bipartisan market base solution to climate change like the one john mccain and joe lieberman work on together a few year ago but if congress won't act soon to protect future generation i will i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive action we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our community for the consequence of climate change and speed the transition to much sustainable source of energy four year ago other country dominate the clean energy market and the job that come with it and we've begin to change that last year wind energy add nearly half of all new power capacity in america so let's generate even much solar energy get cheap by the year let's drive down cost even far as long as country like china keep go all in on clean energy so must we now in the meantime the natural gas boom have lead to clean power and great energy independence we need to encourage that and that's why my administration will keep cut red tape and speed up new oil and gas permit that's get to be part of a all of the above plan but i also want to work with this congress to encourage the research and technology that help natural gas burn even clean and protect our air and our water in fact much of our new find energy be draw from land and water that we the public own together so tonight i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenue to fund a energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our car and truck off oil for good if a nonpartisan coalition of ceos and retire general and admiral can get behind this idea then so can we let's take their advice and free our family and business from the painful spike in gas price we've put up with for far too long i'm also issue a new goal for america let's cut in half the energy waste by our home and business over the next year we'll work with the state to do it that state with the good idea to create job and low energy bill by construct much efficient building will receive federal support to help make that happen america's energy sector be just one part of a age infrastructure badly in need of repair ask any ceo where they'd rather locate and hire a country with deteriorate road and bridge or one with high speed rail and internet high tech school self heal power grid the ceo of siemens america a company that bring hundred of new job to north carolina say that if we upgrade our infrastructure they'll bring even much job and that's the attitude of a lot of company all around the world and i know you want this job create project in your district i've see all that ribbon cutting laughter so tonight i propose a fix it first program to put people to work as soon as possible on our much urgent repair like the nearly structurally deficient bridge across the country and to make sure taxpayer don't shoulder the whole burden i'm also propose a partnership to rebuild america that attract private capital to upgrade what our business need much modern port to move our good modern pipeline to withstand a storm modern school worthy of our child let's prove that there's no good place to do business than here in the unite state of america and let's start right away we can get this do and part of our rebuild effort must also involve our house sector the good news be our house market be finally heal from the collapse of home price be rise at the fast pace in six year home purchase be up nearly percent and construction be expand again but even with mortgage rate near a year low too many family with solid credit who want to buy a home be be reject too many family who never miss a payment and want to refinance be be tell no that's hold our entire economy back we need to fix it right now there's a bill in this congress that would give every responsible homeowner in america the chance to save a year by refinance at today's rate democrat and republican have support it before so what be we wait for take a vote and send me that bill why would we be against that why would that be a partisan issue help folk refinance right now overlap regulation keep responsible young family from buy their first home what's hold us back let's streamline the process and help our economy grow this initiative in manufacture energy infrastructure house all this thing will help entrepreneur and small business owner expand and create new job but none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizen with the skill and train to fill that job and that have to start at the early possible age study after study show that the soon a child begin learn the good he or she do down the road but today few than in four year old be enroll in a high quality preschool program much middle class parent can't afford a few hundred buck a week for a private preschool and for poor kid who need help the much this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their life so tonight i propose work with state to make high quality preschool available to every single child in america that's something we should be able to do every dollar we invest in high quality early childhood education can save much than seven dollar late on by boost graduation rate reduce teen pregnancy even reduce violent crime in state that make it a priority to educate our young child like georgia or oklahoma study show student grow up much likely to read and do math at grade level graduate high school hold a job form much stable family of their own we know this work so let's do what work and make sure none of our child start the race of life already behind let's give our kid that chance let's also make sure that a high school diploma put our kid on a path to a good job right now country like germany focus on graduate their high school student with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community college so that german kid they're ready for a job when they graduate high school they've be train for the job that be there now at school like p tech in brooklyn a collaboration between new york public school and city university of new york and ibm student will graduate with a high school diploma and a associate's degree in computer or engineer we need to give every american student opportunity like this and four year ago we start race to the top a competition that convince almost every state to develop smart curriculum and high standard all for about percent of what we spend on education each year tonight i'm announce a new challenge to redesign america's high school so they good equip graduate for the demand of a high tech economy and we'll reward school that develop new partnership with college and employer and create class that focus on science technology engineer and math the skill today's employer be look for to fill the job that be there right now and will be there in the future now even with good high school much young people will need some high education it's a simple fact the much education you've get the much likely you be to have a good job and work your way into the middle class but today skyrocket cost price too many young people out of a high education or saddle them with unsustainable debt through tax credit grant and good loan we've make college much affordable for million of student and family over the last few year but taxpayer can't keep on subsidize high and high and high cost for high education college must do their part to keep cost down and it's our job to make sure that they do so tonight i ask congress to change the high education act so that affordability and value be include in determine which college receive certain type of federal aid and tomorrow my administration will release a new college scorecard that parent and student can use to compare school base on a simple criterion where you can get the much bang for your educational buck now to grow our middle class our citizen have to have access to the education and train that today's job require but we also have to make sure that america remain a place where everyone who's will to work everybody who's will to work hard have the chance to get ahead our economy be strong when we harness the talent and ingenuity of strive hopeful immigrant and right now leader from the business labor law enforcement faith community they all agree that the time have come to pass comprehensive immigration reform now be the time to do it now be the time to get it do now be the time to get it do real reform mean strong border security and we can build on the progress my administration have already make putting much boot on the southern border than at any time in our history and reduce illegal crossing to their low level in year real reform mean establish a responsible pathway to earn citizenship a path that include pass a background check pay tax and a meaningful penalty learn english and go to the back of the line behind the folk try to come here legally and real reform mean fix the legal immigration system to cut wait period and attract the highly skill entrepreneur and engineer that will help create job and grow our economy in other word we know what need to be do and as we speak bipartisan group in both chamber be work diligently to draft a bill and i applaud their effort so let's get this do send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few month and i will sign it right away and america will be good for it let's get it do let's get it do but we can't stop there we know our economy be strong when our wife our mother our daughter can live their life free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence today the senate pass the violence against woman act that joe biden originally write almost year ago and i now urge the house to do the same good job joe and i ask this congress to declare that woman should earn a live equal to their effort and finally pass the paycheck fairness act this year we know our economy be strong when we reward a honest day's work with honest wage but today a full time worker make the minimum wage earn a year even with the tax relief we put in place a family with two kid that earn the minimum wage still life below the poverty line that's wrong that's why since the last time this congress raise the minimum wage state have choose to bump theirs even high tonight let's declare that in the wealthy nation on earth no one who work full time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to a hour we should be able to get that do this single step would raise the income of million of work family it can mean the difference between grocery or the food bank rend or eviction scrape by or finally get ahead for business across the country it would mean customer with much money in their pocket and a whole lot of folk out there would probably need little help from government in fact work folk shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay have never be high so here's a idea that governor romney and i actually agree on last year let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of live so that it finally become a wage you can live on tonight let's also recognize that there be community in this country where no matter how hard you work it be virtually impossible to get ahead factory town decimate from year of plant pack up inescapable pocket of poverty urban and rural where young adult be still fight for their first job america be not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny and that's why we need to build new ladder of opportunity into the middle class for all who be will to climb them let's offer incentive to company that hire american who've get what it take to fill that job open but have be out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore let's put people back to work rebuild vacant home in run down neighborhood and this year my administration will begin to partner with of the hard hit town in america to get this community back on their foot we'll work with local leader to target resource at public safety and education and house we'll give new tax credit to business that hire and invest and we'll work to strengthen family by remove the financial deterrent to marriage for low income couple and do much to encourage fatherhood because what make you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child it's have the courage to raise one and we want to encourage that we want to help that strong family strong community a strong america it be this kind of prosperity broad share build on a thrive middle class that have always be the source of our progress at home it's also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world tonight we stand unite in salute the troop and civilian who sacrifice every day to protect us because of them we can say with confidence that america will complete its mission in afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeat the core of al qaeda already we have bring home of our brave serviceman and woman this spring our force will move into a support role while afghan security force take the lead tonight i can announce that over the next year another american troop will come home from afghanistan this drawdown will continue and by the end of next year our war in afghanistan will be over beyond america's commitment to a unify and sovereign afghanistan will endure but the nature of our commitment will change we're negotiate a agreement with the afghan government that focus on two mission train and equip afghan force so that the country do not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism effort that allow us to pursue the remnant of al qaeda and their affiliate today the organization that attack us on be a shadow of its former self it's true different al qaeda affiliate and extremist group have emerge from the arabian peninsula to africa the threat this group pose be evolve but to meet this threat we don't need to send ten of thousand of our son and daughter abroad or occupy other nation instead we'll need to help country like yemen and libya and somalia provide for their own security and help ally who take the fight to terrorist as we have in mali and where necessary through a range of capability we will continue to take direct action against that terrorist who pose the grave threat to american now as we do we must enlist our value in the fight that's why my administration have work tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism effort throughout we have keep congress fully inform of our effort i recognize that in our democracy no one should just take my word for it that we're do thing the right way so in the month ahead i will continue to engage congress to ensure not only that our target detention and prosecution of terrorist remain consistent with our law and system of check and balance but that our effort be even much transparent to the american people and to the world of course our challenge don't end with al qaeda america will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's much dangerous weapon the regime in north korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meet their international obligation provocation of the sort we see last night will only far isolate them as we stand by our ally strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in take firm action in response to this threat likewise the leader of iran must recognize that now be the time for a diplomatic solution because a coalition stand unite in demand that they meet their obligation and we will do what be necessary to prevent them from get a nuclear weapon at the same time we'll engage russia to seek far reduction in our nuclear arsenal and continue lead the global effort to secure nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hand because our ability to influence other depend on our willingness to lead and meet our obligation america must also face the rapidly grow threat from cyber attack now we know hacker steal people's identity and infiltrate private email we know foreign country and company swipe our corporate secret now our enemy be also seek the ability to sabotage our power grid our financial institution our air traffic control system we cannot look back year from now and wonder why we do nothing in the face of real threat to our security and our economy and that's why early today i sign a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defense by increase information share and develop standard to protect our national security our job and our privacy but now congress must act as good by pass legislation to give our government a great capacity to secure our network and deter attack this be something we should be able to get do on a bipartisan basis now even as we protect our people we should remember that today's world present not just danger not just threat it present opportunity to boost american export support american job and level the play field in the grow market of asia we intend to complete negotiation on a trans pacific partnership and tonight i'm announce that we will launch talk on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union because trade that be fair and free across the atlantic support million of good pay american job we also know that progress in the much impoverish part of our world enrich us all not only because it create new market much stable order in certain region of the world but also because it's the right thing to do in many place people live on little much than a dollar a day so the unite state will join with our ally to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decade by connect much people to the global economy by empower woman by give our young and bright mind new opportunity to serve and help community to fee and power and educate themselves by save the world's child from preventable death and by realize the promise of a aid free generation which be within our reach you see america must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change i see the power of hope last year in rangoon in burma when aung san suu kyi welcome a american president into the home where she have be imprison for year when thousand of burmese line the street wave american flag include a man who say there be justice and law in the unite state i want our country to be like that in defense of freedom we'll remain the anchor of strong alliance from the americas to africa from europe to asia in the middle east we will stand with citizen as they demand their universal right and support stable transition to democracy we know the process will be messy and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in country like egypt but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental right of all people we'll keep the pressure on a syrian regime that have murder its own people and support opposition leader that respect the right of every syrian and we will stand steadfast with israel in pursuit of security and a last peace this be the message i'll deliver when i travel to the middle east next month and all this work depend on the courage and sacrifice of that who serve in dangerous place at great personal risk our diplomat our intelligence officer and the man and woman of the unite state arm force as long as i'm commander in chief we will do whatever we must to protect that who serve their country abroad and we will maintain the good military the world have ever know we'll invest in new capability even as we reduce waste and wartime spend we will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal benefit for their family gay and straight we will draw upon the courage and skill of our sister and daughter and mom because woman have prove under fire that they be ready for combat we will keep faith with our veteran invest in world class care include mental health care for our wound warrior applause support our military family give our veteran the benefit and education and job opportunity that they have earn and i want to thank my wife michelle and dr jill biden for their continue dedication to serve our military family as good as they have serve us thank you honey thank you jill defend our freedom though be not just the job of our military alone we must all do our part to make sure our god give right be protect here at home that include one of the much fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party be deny that right because they can't afford to wait for five or six or seven hour just to cast their ballot we be betray our ideal so tonight i'm announce a nonpartisan commission to improve the vote experience in america and it definitely need improvement i'm ask two long time expert in the field who by the way recently serve as the top attorney for my campaign and for governor romney's campaign to lead it we can fix this and we will the american people demand it and so do our democracy of course what i've say tonight matter little if we don't come together to protect our much precious resource our child it have be two month since newtown i know this be not the first time this country have debate how to reduce gun violence but this time be different overwhelm majority of american american who believe in the 2 amendment have come together around common sense reform like background check that will make it hard for criminal to get their hand on a gun senator of both party be work together on tough new law to prevent anyone from buy gun for resale to criminal police chief be ask our help to get weapon of war and massive ammunition magazine off our street because this police chief they're tire of see their guy and gal be outgunned each of this proposal deserve a vote in congress now if you want to vote no that's your choice but this proposal deserve a vote because in the two month since newtown much than a thousand birthday graduation anniversary have be steal from our life by a bullet from a gun much than a thousand one of that we lose be a young girl name hadiya pendleton she be year old she love fig newton and lip gloss she be a majorette she be so good to her friend they all think they be her good friend just three week ago she be here in washington with her classmate perform for her country at my inauguration and a week late she be shoot and kill in a chicago park after school just a mile away from my house hadiya's parent nate and cleo be in this chamber tonight along with much than two dozen american whose life have be tear apart by gun violence they deserve a vote they deserve a vote gabby giffords deserve a vote the family of newtown deserve a vote the family of aurora deserve a vote the family of oak creek and tucson and blacksburg and the countless other community rip open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote they deserve a simple vote our action will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country in fact no law no initiative no administrative act will perfectly solve all the challenge i've outline tonight but we be never send here to be perfect we be send here to make what difference we can to secure this nation expand opportunity uphold our ideal through the hard often frustrate but absolutely necessary work of self government we be send here to look out for our fellow american the same way they look out for one another every single day usually without fanfare all across this country we should follow their example we should follow the example of a new york city nurse name menchu sanchez when hurricane sandy plunge her hospital into darkness she wasn't think about how her own home be fare her mind be on the precious newborn in her care and the rescue plan she devise that keep them all safe we should follow the example of a north miami woman name desiline victor when desiline arrive at her poll place she be tell the wait to vote may be six hour and as time tick by her concern be not with her tire body or ache foot but whether folk like her would get to have their say and hour after hour a throng of people stay in line to support her because desiline be year old and they erupt in cheer when she finally put on a sticker that read i vote mr speaker mr vice president member of congress my fellow american today in america a teacher spend extra time with a student who need it and do her part to lift america's graduation rate to its high level in much than three decade a entrepreneur flip on the light in her tech startup and do her part to add to the much than eight million new job our business have create over the past four year a autoworker fine tune some of the good much fuel efficient car in the world and do his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil a farmer prepare for the spring after the strong five year stretch of farm export in our history a rural doctor give a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother can afford a man take the bus home from the graveyard shift bone tire but dream big dream for his son and in tight knit community across america father and mother will tuck in their kid put a arm around their spouse remember fall comrade and give thank for be home from a war that after twelve long year be finally come to a end tonight this chamber speak with one voice to the people we represent it be you our citizen who make the state of our union strong here be the result of your effort the low unemployment rate in over five year a rebound house market a manufacture sector that's add job for the first time since the 1990s much oil produce at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time that's happen in nearly twenty year our deficit cut by much than half and for the first time in over a decade business leader around the world have declare that china be no long the world's numb one place to invest america be that's why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america after five year of grit and determine effort the unite state be good position for the 21st century than any other nation on earth the question for everyone in this chamber run through every decision we make this year be whether we be go to help or hinder this progress for several year now this town have be consume by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government it's a important debate one that date back to our very found but when that debate prevent us from carry out even the much basic function of our democracy when our difference shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the unite state then we be not do right by the american people as president i'm commit to make washington work good and rebuild the trust of the people who send us here i believe much of you be too last month thank to the work of democrat and republican this congress finally produce a budget that undo some of last year's severe cut to priority like education nobody get everything they want and we can still do much to invest in this country's future while bring down our deficit in a balance way but the budget compromise should leave us free to focus on create new job not create new crisis in the come month let's see where else we can make progress together let's make this a year of action that's what much american want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their life their hope their aspiration and what i believe unite the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor be the simple profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead let's face it that belief have suffer some serious blow over much than three decade even before the great recession hit massive shift in technology and global competition have eliminate a lot of good middle class job and weaken the economic foundation that family depend on today after four year of economic growth corporate profit and stock price have rarely be high and that at the top have never do good but average wage have barely budge inequality have deepen upward mobility have stall the cold hard fact be that even in the midst of recovery too many american be work much than ever just to get by let alone get ahead and too many still aren't work at all our job be to reverse this trend it won't happen right away and we won't agree on everything but what i offer tonight be a set of concrete practical proposal to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladder of opportunity into the middle class some require congressional action and i'm eager to work with all of you but america do not stand still and neither will i so wherever and whenever i can take step without legislation to expand opportunity for much american family that's what i'm go to do as usual our first lady set a good example michelle's let's move partnership with school business and local leader have help bring down childhood obesity rate for the first time in thirty year a achievement that will improve life and reduce health care cost for decade to come the join force alliance that michelle and jill biden launch have already encourage employer to hire or train nearly veteran and military spouse take a page from that playbook the white house just organize a college opportunity summit where already university business and nonprofit have make concrete commitment to reduce inequality in access to high education and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus across the country we're partner with mayor governor and state legislature on issue from homelessness to marriage equality the point be there be million of american outside washington who be tire of stale political argument and be move this country forward they believe and i believe that here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dream that's what draw our forebear here it's how the daughter of a factory worker be ceo of america's large automaker how the son of a barkeeper be speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the great nation on earth opportunity be who we be and the define project of our generation be to restore that promise we know where to start the good measure of opportunity be access to a good job with the economy pick up speed company say they intend to hire much people this year and over half of big manufacturer say they're think of insourcing job from abroad so let's make that decision easy for much company both democrat and republican have argue that our tax code be riddle with wasteful complicate loophole that punish business invest here and reward company that keep profit abroad let's flip that equation let's work together to close that loophole end that incentive to ship job overseas and low tax rate for business that create job here at home moreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create job rebuild our road upgrade our port unclogging our commute because in today's global economy first class job gravitate to first class infrastructure we'll need congress to protect much than three million job by finish transportation and waterway bill this summer but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permit process for key project so we can get much construction worker on the job as fast as possible we also have the chance right now to beat other country in the race for the next wave of high tech manufacture job my administration have launch two hub for high tech manufacture in raleigh and youngstown where we've connect business to research university that can help america lead the world in advance technology tonight i'm announce we'll launch six much this year bipartisan bill in both house can double the numb of this hub and the job they create so get that bill to my desk and put much american back to work let's do much to help the entrepreneur and small business owner who create much new job in america over the past five year my administration have make much loan to small business owner than any other and when ninety eight percent of our exporter be small business new trade partnership with europe and the asia pacific will help them create much job we need to work together on tool like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our worker protect our environment and open new market to new good stamp make in the usa china and europe aren't stand on the sideline neither should we we know that the nation that go all in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow this be a edge america cannot surrender federally fund research help lead to the idea and invention behind google and smartphones that's why congress should undo the damage do by last year's cut to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery whether it's vaccine that stay ahead of drug resistant bacterium or paper thin material that's strong than steel and let's pass a patent reform bill that allow our business to stay focus on innovation not costly needless litigation now one of the big factor in bring much job back be our commitment to american energy the all of the above energy strategy i announce a few year ago be work and today america be close to energy independence than we've be in decade one of the reason why be natural gas if extract safely it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with little of the carbon pollution that cause climate change business plan to invest almost billion in new factory that use natural gas i'll cut red tape to help state get that factory build and this congress can help by putting people to work build fuel station that shift much car and truck from foreign oil to american natural gas my administration will keep work with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthen protection of our air our water and our community and while we're at it i'll use my authority to protect much of our pristine federal land for future generation it's not just oil and natural gas production that's boom we're become a global leader in solar too every four minute another american home or business go solar every panel pound into place by a worker whose job can't be outsource let's continue that progress with a smart tax policy that stop give billion a year to fossil fuel industry that don't need it so that we can invest much in fuel of the future that do and even as we've increase energy production we've partner with business builder and local community to reduce the energy we consume when we rescue our automaker for example we work with them to set high fuel efficiency standard for our car in the come month i'll build on that success by set new standard for our truck so we can keep drive down oil import and what we pay at the pump take together our energy policy be create job and lead to a clean safe planet over the past eight year the unite state have reduce our total carbon pollution much than any other nation on earth but we have to act with much urgency because a change climate be already harm western community struggle with drought and coastal city deal with flood that's why i direct my administration to work with state utility and other to set new standard on the amount of carbon pollution our power plant be allow to dump into the air the shift to a clean energy economy won't happen overnight and it will require tough choice along the way but the debate be settle climate change be a fact and when our children's child look us in the eye and ask if we do all we can to leave them a safe much stable world with new source of energy i want us to be able to say yes we do finally if we be serious about economic growth it be time to heed the call of business leader labor leader faith leader and law enforcement and fix our break immigration system republican and democrat in the senate have act i know that member of both party in the house want to do the same independent economist say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficit by almost trillion in the next two decade and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dream to study invent and contribute to our culture they make our country a much attractive place for business to locate and create job for everyone so let's get immigration reform do this year the idea i've outline so far can speed up growth and create much job but in this rapidly change economy we have to make sure that every american have the skill to fill that job the good news be we know how to do it two year ago as the auto industry come roar back andra rush open up a manufacture firm in detroit she know that ford need part for the good sell truck in america and she know how to make them she just need the workforce so she dial up what we call a american job center place where folk can walk in to get the help or train they need to find a new job or good job she be flood with new worker and today detroit manufacture system have much than employee what andra and her employee experience be how it should be for every employer and every job seeker so tonight i've ask vice president biden to lead a across the board reform of america's train program to make sure they have one mission train american with the skill employer need and match them to good job that need to be fill right now that mean much on the job train and much apprenticeship that set a young worker on a upward trajectory for life it mean connect company to community college that can help design train to fill their specific need and if congress want to help you can concentrate fund on prove program that connect much ready to work american with ready to be fill job i'm also convince we can help american return to the workforce fast by reform unemployment insurance so that it's much effective in today's economy but first this congress need to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for million people let me tell you why misty demars be a mother of two young boy she'd be steadily employ since she be a teenager she put herself through college she'd never collect unemployment benefit in may she and her husband use their life saving to buy their first home a week late budget cut claim the job she love last month when their unemployment insurance be cut off she sit down and write me a letter the kind i get every day we be the face of the unemployment crisis she write i be not dependent on the government our country depend on people like us who build career contribute to society care about our neighbor i be confident that in time i will find a job i will pay my tax and we will raise our child in their own home in the community we love please give us this chance congress give this hardworking responsible american that chance they need our help but much important this country need them in the game that's why i've be ask ceos to give much long term unemployed worker a fair shoot at that new job and new chance to support their family this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real tonight i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same because we be strong when america field a full team of course it's not enough to train today's workforce we also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce by guarantee every child access to a world class education estiven rodriguez couldn't speak a word of english when he move to new york city at age nine but last month thank to the support of great teacher and a innovative tutor program he lead a march of his classmate through a crowd of cheer parent and neighbor from their high school to the post office where they mail off their college application and this son of a factory worker just find out he's go to college this fall five year ago we set out to change the odd for all our kid we work with lender to reform student loan and today much young people be earn college degree than ever before race to the top with the help of governor from both party have help state raise expectation and performance teacher and principal in school from tennessee to washington d.c be make big stride in prepare student with skill for the new economy problem solve critical think science technology engineer and math some of this change be hard it require everything from much challenge curriculum and much demand parent to good support for teacher and new way to measure how good our kid think not how good they can fill in a bubble on a test but it's worth it and it's work the problem be we're still not reach enough kid and we're not reach them in time that have to change research show that one of the good investment we can make in a child's life be high quality early education last year i ask this congress to help state make high quality pre k available to every four year old as a parent as good as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime thirty state have raise pre k fund on their own they know we can't wait so just as we work with state to reform our school this year we'll invest in new partnership with state and community across the country in a race to the top for our young child and as congress decide what it's go to do i'm go to pull together a coalition of elect official business leader and philanthropist will to help much kid access the high quality pre k they need last year i also pledge to connect percent of our student to high speed broadband over the next four year tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and company like apple microsoft sprint and verizon we've get a down payment to start connect much than school and twenty million student over the next two year without add a dime to the deficit we're work to redesign high school and partner them with college and employer that offer the real world education and hand on train that can lead directly to a job and career we're shake up our system of high education to give parent much information and college much incentive to offer good value so that no middle class kid be price out of a college education we're offer million the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payment to ten percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even much american who feel trap by student loan debt and i'm reach out to some of america's lead foundation and corporation on a new initiative to help much young man of color face tough odd stay on track and reach their full potential the bottom line be michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country give us but we know our opportunity agendum won't be complete and too many young people enter the workforce today will see the american dream as a empty promise unless we do much to make sure our economy honor the dignity of work and hard work pay off for every single american today woman make up about half our workforce but they still make cent for every dollar a man earn that be wrong and in it's a embarrassment a woman deserve equal pay for equal work she deserve to have a baby without sacrifice her job a mother deserve a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without run into hardship and you know what a father do too it's time to do away with workplace policy that belong in a mad man episode this year let's all come together congress the white house and business from wall street to main street to give every woman the opportunity she deserve because i firmly believe when woman succeed america succeed now woman hold a majority of low wage job but they're not the only one stifle by stagnant wage american understand that some people will earn much than other and we don't resend that who by virtue of their effort achieve incredible success but american overwhelmingly agree that no one who work full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty in the year since i ask this congress to raise the minimum wage five state have pass law to raise theirs many business have do it on their own nick chute be here tonight with his boss john soranno john's a owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick help make the dough only now he make much of it john just give his employee a raise to ten buck a hour a decision that ease their financial stress and boost their morale tonight i ask much of america's business leader to follow john's lead and do what you can to raise your employee wage to every mayor governor and state legislator in america i say you don't have to wait for congress to act american will support you if you take this on and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporation like costco see high wage as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too in the come week i will issue a executive order require federal contractor to pay their federally fund employee a fair wage of at less a hour because if you cook our troop meal or wash their dish you shouldn't have to live in poverty of course to reach million much congress need to get on board today the federal minimum wage be worth about twenty percent little than it be when ronald reagan first stand here tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lift the minimum wage to this will help family it will give business customer with much money to spend it doesn't involve any new bureaucratic program so join the rest of the country say yes give america a raise there be other step we can take to help family make end meet and few be much effective at reduce inequality and help family pull themselves up through hard work than the earn income tax credit right now it help about half of all parent at some point but i agree with republican like senator rubio that it doesn't do enough for single worker who don't have kid so let's work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help much american get ahead let's do much to help american save for retirement today much worker don't have a pension a social security check often isn't enough on its own and while the stock market have double over the last five year that doesn't help folk who don't have 401ks that's why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for work american to start their own retirement saving myra it's a new saving bond that encourage folk to build a nest egg myra guarantee a decent return with no risk of lose what you put in and if this congress want to help work with me to fix a upside down tax code that give big tax break to help the wealthy save but do little to nothing for middle class american offer every american access to a automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can and since the much important investment many family make be their home send me legislation that protect taxpayer from foot the bill for a house crisis ever again and keep the dream of homeownership alive for future generation of american one last point on financial security for decade few thing expose hard work family to economic hardship much than a break health care system and in case you haven't hear we're in the process of fix that a pre exist condition use to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physician assistant and single mom from arizona couldn't get health insurance but on january 1st she get cover on january 3rd she feel a sharp pain on january 6th she have emergency surgery just one week early amanda say that surgery would've mean bankruptcy that's what health insurance reform be all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strike you don't have to lose everything already because of the affordable care act much than three million american under age have gain coverage under their parent plan much than nine million american have sign up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage and here's another numb zero because of this law no american can ever again be drop or deny coverage for a preexist condition like asthma back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charge much just because she's a woman and we do all this while add year to medicare's finance keep medicare premium flat and lower prescription cost for million of senior now i don't expect to convince my republican friend on the merit of this law but i know that the american people aren't interest in refighting old battle so again if you have specific plan to cut cost cover much people and increase choice tell america what you'd do differently let's see if the number add up but let's not have another forty something vote to repeal a law that's already help million of american like amanda the first forty be plenty we get it we all owe it to the american people to say what we're for not just what we're against and if you want to know the real impact this law be have just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky who's here tonight kentucky's not the much liberal part of the country but he's like a man possess when it come to cover his commonwealth's family they be our friend and neighbor he say they be people we shop and go to church with farmer out on the tractor grocery clerk they be people who go to work every morning pray they don't get sick no one deserve to live that way steve's right that's why tonight i ask every american who know someone without health insurance to help them get cover by march 31st mom get on your kid to sign up kid call your mom and walk her through the application it will give her some peace of mind plus she'll appreciate hear from you after all that's the spirit that have always move this nation forward it's the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dream but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dream as good citizenship mean stand up for everyone's right to vote last year part of the vote right act be weaken but conservative republican and liberal democrat be work together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appoint last year have offer reform so that no one have to wait much than a half hour to vote let's support this effort it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drive our democracy citizenship mean stand up for the life that gun violence steal from us each day i have see the courage of parent student pastor and police officer all over this country who say we be not afraid and i intend to keep try with or without congress to help stop much tragedy from visit innocent american in our movie theater shop mall or school like sandy hook citizenship demand a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government a obligation to serve to our community and i know this chamber agree that few american give much to their country than our diplomat and the man and woman of the unite state arm force tonight because of the extraordinary troop and civilian who risk and lie down their life to keep us free the unite state be much secure when i take office nearly american be serve in iraq and afghanistan today all our troop be out of iraq much than of our troop have already come home from afghanistan with afghan force now in the lead for their own security our troop have move to a support role together with our ally we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and america's long war will finally be over after we will support a unify afghanistan as it take responsibility for its own future if the afghan government sign a security agreement that we have negotiate a small force of american can remain in afghanistan with nato ally to carry out two narrow mission train and assist afghan force and counterterrorism operation to pursue any remnant of al qaeda for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorist do not launch attack against our country the fact be that danger remain while we have put al qaeda's core leadership on a path to defeat the threat have evolve as al qaeda affiliate and other extremist take root in different part of the world in yemen somalia iraq and mali we have to keep work with partner to disrupt and disable this network in syria we'll support the opposition that reject the agendum of terrorist network here at home we'll keep strengthen our defense and combat new threat like cyberattacks and as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our man and woman in uniform and invest in the capability they need to succeed in future mission we have to remain vigilant but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone as commander in chief i have use force when need to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office but i will not send our troop into harm's way unless it's truly necessary nor will i allow our son and daughter to be mire in open end conflict we must fight the battle that need to be fight not that that terrorist prefer from us large scale deployment that drain our strength and may ultimately fee extremism so even as we aggressively pursue terrorist network through much target effort and by build the capacity of our foreign partner america must move off a permanent war foot that's why i've impose prudent limit on the use of drone for we will not be safe if people abroad believe we strike within their country without regard for the consequence that's why work with this congress i will reform our surveillance program because the vital work of our intelligence community depend on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people be not be violate and with the afghan war end this need to be the year congress lift the remain restriction on detainee transfer and we close the prison at guantanamo bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remain true to our constitutional ideal and set a example for the rest of the world you see in a world of complex threat our security and leadership depend on all element of our power include strong and principled diplomacy american diplomacy have rally much than fifty country to prevent nuclear material from fall into the wrong hand and allow us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpile american diplomacy back by the threat of force be why syria's chemical weapon be be eliminate and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy be support israeli and palestinian as they engage in difficult but necessary talk to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and a independent state for palestinian and last peace and security for the state of israel a jewish state that know america will always be at their side and it be american diplomacy back by pressure that have halt the progress of iran's nuclear program and roll part of that program back for the very first time in a decade as we gather here tonight iran have begin to eliminate its stockpile of high level of enrich uranium it be not install advance centrifuge unprecedented inspection help the world verify every day that iran be not build a bomb and with our ally and partner we're engage in negotiation to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share prevent iran from obtain a nuclear weapon this negotiation will be difficult they may not succeed we be clear eye about iran's support for terrorist organization like hezbollah which threaten our ally and the mistrust between our nation cannot be wish away but this negotiation do not rely on trust any long term deal we agree to must be base on verifiable action that convince us and the international community that iran be not build a nuclear bomb if john f kennedy and ronald reagan can negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with little powerful adversary today the sanction that we put in place help make this opportunity possible but let me be clear if this congress send me a new sanction bill now that threaten to derail this talk i will veto it for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed if iran's leader do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for much sanction and stand ready to exercise all option to make sure iran do not build a nuclear weapon but if iran's leader do seize the chance then iran can take a important step to rejoin the community of nation and we will have resolve one of the lead security challenge of our time without the risk of war finally let's remember that our leadership be define not just by our defense against threat but by the enormous opportunity to do good and promote understand around the globe to forge great cooperation to expand new market to free people from fear and want and no one be good position to take advantage of that opportunity than america our alliance with europe remain the strong the world have ever know from tunisia to burma we're support that who be will to do the hard work of build democracy in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their country's future across africa we're bring together business and government to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty in the americas we be build new tie of commerce but we're also expand cultural and educational exchange among young people and we will continue to focus on the asia pacific where we support our ally shape a future of great security and prosperity and extend a hand to that devastate by disaster as we do in the philippines when our marine and civilian rush to aid that batter by a typhoon and be greet with word like we will never forget your kindness and god bless america we do this thing because they help promote our long term security and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human be regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when team usa march the red white and blue into the olympic stadium and bring home the gold my fellow american no other country in the world do what we do on every issue the world turn to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military may but because of the ideal we stand for and the burden we bear to advance them no one know this good than that who serve in uniform as this time of war draw to a close a new generation of hero return to civilian life we'll keep slash that backlog so our veteran receive the benefit they've earn and our wound warrior receive the health care include the mental health care that they need we'll keep work to help all our veteran translate their skill and leadership into job here at home and we all continue to join force to honor and support our remarkable military family let me tell you about one of that family i've come to know i first meet cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th

be easy cory be here tonight and like the army he love like the america he serve sergeant first class cory remsburg never give up and he do not quit my fellow american man and woman like cory remind us that america have never come easy our freedom our democracy have never be easy sometimes we stumble we make mistake we get frustrate or discourage but for much than two hundred year we have put that thing aside and place our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibility of individual achievement to free other nation from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the word set to paper by our founder be make real for every citizen the america we want for our kid a rise america where honest work be plentiful and community be strong where prosperity be widely share and opportunity for all let us go as far as our dream and toil will take us none of it be easy but if we work together if we summon what be good in us with our foot plant firmly in today but our eye cast towards tomorrow i know it's within our reach believe it god bless you and god bless the unite state of america mr speaker mr vice president member of congress my fellow american we be year into this new century fifteen year that dawn with terror touch our shore that unfold with a new generation fight two long and costly war that see a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world it have be and still be a hard time for many but tonight we turn the page tonight after a breakthrough year for america our economy be grow and create job at the fast pace since our unemployment rate be now low than it be before the financial crisis much of our kid be graduate than ever before much of our people be insure than ever before and we be as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've be in almost year tonight for the first time since our combat mission in afghanistan be over six year ago nearly american troop serve in iraq and afghanistan today few than remain and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this generation who have serve to keep us safe we be humble and grateful for your service america for all that we have endure for all the grit and hard work require to come back for all the task that lie ahead know this the shadow of crisis have pass and the state of the union be strong at this moment with a grow economy shrink deficit bustle industry boom energy production we have rise from recession free to write our own future than any other nation on earth it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next year and for decade to come will we accept a economy where only a few of us do spectacularly good or will we commit ourselves to a economy that generate rise income and chance for everyone who make the effort will we approach the world fearful and reactive drag into costly conflict that strain our military and set back our stand or will we lead wisely use all element of our power to defeat new threat and protect our planet will we allow ourselves to be sort into faction and turn against one another or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that have always propel america forward in week i will send this congress a budget fill with idea that be practical not partisan and in the month ahead i'll crisscross the country make a case for that idea so tonight i want to focus little on a checklist of proposal and focus much on the value at stake in the choice before us it begin with our economy seven year ago rebekah and ben erler of minneapolis be newlywed she wait table he work construction their first child jack be on the way they be young and in love in america and it doesn't get much good than that if only we have know rebekah write to me last spring what be about to happen to the house and construction market as the crisis worsen ben's business dry up so he take what job he can find even if they keep him on the road for long stretch of time rebekah take out student loan and enroll in community college and retrain for a new career they sacrifice for each other and slowly it pay off they buy their first home they have a 2 son henry rebekah get a good job and then a raise ben be back in construction and home for dinner every night it be amaze rebekah write what you can bounce back from when you have to we be a strong tight knit family who have make it through some very very hard time we be a strong tight knit family who have make it through some very very hard time america rebekah and ben's story be our story they represent the million who have work hard and scrimp and sacrifice and retool you be the reason that i run for this office you be the people i be think of year ago today in the dark month of the crisis when i stand on the step of this capitol and promise we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation and it have be your resilience your effort that have make it possible for our country to emerge strong we believe we can reverse the tide of outsource and draw new job to our shore and over the past year our business have create much than million new job we believe we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet and today america be numb one in oil and gas america be numb one in wind power every week we bring online as much solar power as we do in all of and thank to low gas price and high fuel standard the typical family this year should save about at the pump we believe we can prepare our kid for a much competitive world and today our young student have earn the high math and read score on record our high school graduation rate have hit a alltime high much american finish college than ever before we believe that sensible regulation can prevent another crisis shield family from ruin and encourage fair competition today we have new tool to stop taxpayer fund bailout and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lend and abusive credit card practice and in the past year alone about million uninsured american finally gain the security of health coverage at every step we be tell our goal be misguide or too ambitious that we would crush job and explode deficit instead we've see the fast economic growth in over a decade our deficit cut by two third a stock market that have double and health care inflation at its low rate in year this be good news people so the verdict be clear middle class economics work expand opportunity work and this policy will continue to work as long as politic don't get in the way we can't slow down business or put our economy at risk with government shutdown or fiscal showdown we can't put the security of family at risk by take away their health insurance or unravel the new rule on wall street or refighting past battle on immigration when we've get to fix a break system and if a bill come to my desk that try to do any of this thing i will veto it it will have earn my veto today thank to a grow economy the recovery be touch much and much life wage be finally start to rise again we know that much small business owner plan to raise their employee pay than at any time since but here's the thing that of us here tonight we need to set our sight high than just make sure government doesn't screw thing up that government doesn't halt the progress we're make we need to do much than just do no harm tonight together let's do much to restore the link between hard work and grow opportunity for every american because family like rebekah's still need our help she and ben be work as hard as ever but they've have to forego vacation and a new car so that they can pay off student loan and save for retirement friday night pizza that's a big splurge basic childcare for jack and henry cost much than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota like million of hard work american rebekah isn't ask for a handout but she be ask that we look for much way to help family get ahead and in fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country have take bold action to adapt to new circumstance and to make sure everyone get a fair shoot we set up worker protection social security medicare medicaid to protect ourselves from the harsh adversity we give our citizen school and college infrastructure and the internet tool they need to go as far as their effort and their dream will take them that's what middle class economics be the idea that this country do good when everyone get their fair shoot everyone do their fair share everyone play by the same set of rule we don't just want everyone to share in america's success we want everyone to contribute to our success so what do middle class economics require in our time first middle class economics mean help work family feel much secure in a world of constant change that mean help folk afford childcare college health care a home retirement and my budget will address each of this issue lower the tax of work family and putting thousand of dollar back into their pocket each year here's one example during world war ii when man like my grandfather go off to war have woman like my grandmother in the workforce be a national security priority so this country provide universal childcare in today's economy when have both parent in the workforce be a economic necessity for many family we need affordable high quality childcare much than ever it's not a nice to have it's a must have so it's time we stop treat childcare as a side issue or as a women's issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it be for all of us and that's why my plan will make quality childcare much available and much affordable for every middle class and low income family with young child in america by create much slot and a new tax cut of up to per child per year here's another example today we be the only advance country on earth that doesn't guarantee pay sick leave or pay maternity leave to our worker forty three million worker have no pay sick leave million think about that and that force too many parent to make the gut wrench choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home so i'll be take new action to help state adopt pay leave law of their own and since pay sick leave win where it be on the ballot last november let's put it to a vote right here in washington send me a bill that give every worker in america the opportunity to earn day of pay sick leave it's the right thing to do it's the right thing to do of course nothing help family make end meet like high wage that's why this congress still need to pass a law that make sure a woman be pay the same as a man for do the same work i mean it's it's time we still need to make sure employee get the overtime they've earn and to everyone in this congress who still refuse to raise the minimum wage i say this if you truly believe you can work full time and support a family on little than a year try it if not vote to give million of the hard work people in america a raise now this idea won't make everybody rich won't relieve every hardship that's not the job of government to give work family a fair shoot we still need much employer to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that invest in their workforce be in their company's long term interest we still need law that strengthen rather than weaken union and give american worker a voice but you know thing like childcare and sick leave and equal pay thing like low mortgage premium and a high minimum wage this idea will make a meaningful difference in the life of million of family that's a fact and that's what all of us republican and democrat alike be send here to do now 2 to make sure folk keep earn high wage down the road we have to do much to help american upgrade their skill america thrive in the 20th century because we make high school free send a generation of gi to college train the good workforce in the world we be ahead of the curve but other country catch on and in a 21st century economy that reward knowledge like never before we need to up our game we need to do much by the end of this decade two in three job opening will require some high education two in three and yet we still live in a country where too many bright strive american be price out of the education they need it's not fair to them and it's sure not smart for our future and that's why i'm send this congress a bold new plan to low the cost of community college to zero keep in mind percent of our college student choose community college some be young and start out some be old and look for a good job some be veteran and single parent try to transition back into the job market whoever you be this plan be your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt understand you've get to earn it you've get to keep your grade up and graduate on time tennessee a state with republican leadership and chicago a city with democratic leadership be show that free community college be possible i want to spread that idea all across america so that year of college become as free and universal in america as high school be today let's stay ahead of the curve and i want to work with this congress to make sure that already burden with student loan can reduce their monthly payment so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dream thank to vice president biden's great work to update our job train system we're connect community college with local employer to train worker to fill high pay job like code and nurse and robotic tonight i'm also ask much business to follow the lead of company like cv and up and offer much educational benefit and pay apprenticeship opportunity that give worker the chance to earn high pay job even if they don't have a high education and as a new generation of veteran come home we owe them every opportunity to live the american dream they help defend already we've make stride towards ensure that every veteran have access to the high quality care we're slash the backlog that have too many veteran wait year to get the benefit they need and we're make it easy for vet to translate their train and experience into civilian job and join force the national campaign launch by michelle and jill biden thank you michelle thank you jill have help nearly veteran and military spouse get a new job so to every ceo in america let me repeat if you want somebody who's go to get the job do and do right hire a veteran finally as we good train our worker we need the new economy to keep churn out high wage job for our worker to fill since america have put much people back to work than europe japan and all advance economy combine our manufacturer have add almost new job some of our bedrock sector like our auto industry be boom but there be also million of american who work in job that didn't even exist or year ago job at company like google and ebay and tesla so no one know for certain which industry will generate the job of the future but we do know we want them here in america we know that and that's why the 3 part of middle class economics be all about build the much competitive economy anywhere the place where business want to locate and hire twenty first century business need 21st century infrastructure modern port and strong bridge fast train and the fast internet democrat and republican use to agree on this so let's set our sight high than a single oil pipeline let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that can create much than time as many job per year and make this country strong for decade to come let's do it let's get it do let's get it do twenty first century business include small business need to sell much american product overseas today our business export much than ever and exporter tend to pay their worker high wage but as we speak china want to write the rule for the world's fast grow region that would put our worker and our business at a disadvantage why would we let that happen we should write that rule we should level the play field and that's why i'm ask both party to give me trade promotion authority to protect american worker with strong new trade deal from asia to europe that aren't just free but be also fair it's the right thing to do look i'm the first one to admit that past trade deal haven't always live up to the hype and that's why we've go after country that break the rule at our expense but percent of the world's customer live outside our border we can't close ourselves off from that opportunity much than half of manufacture executive have say they're actively look to bring job back from china so let's give them one much reason to get it do twenty first century business will rely on american science and technology research and development i want the country that eliminate polio and map the human genome to lead a new era of medicine one that deliver the right treatment at the right time in some patient with cystic fibrosis this approach have reverse a disease once think unstoppable so tonight i'm launch a new precision medicine initiative to bring us close to cure disease like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalize information we need to keep ourselves and our family healthy we can do this i intend to protect a free and open internet extend its reach to every classroom and every community and help folk build the fast network so that the next generation of digital innovator and entrepreneur have the platform to keep reshape our world i want american to win the race for the kind of discovery that unleash new job convert sunlight into liquid fuel create revolutionary prosthetic so that a veteran who give his arm for his country can play catch with his kid again push out into the solar system not just to visit but to stay last month we launch a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send american astronaut to mar and in month to prepare us for that mission scott kelly will begin a year long stay in space so good luck captain make sure to instagram it we're proud of you now the truth be when it come to issue like infrastructure and basic research i know there's bipartisan support in this chamber member of both party have tell me so where we too often run onto the rock be how to pay for this investment as american we don't mind pay our fair share of tax as long as everybody else do too but for far too long lobbyist have rig the tax code with loophole that let some corporation pay nothing while other pay full freight they've riddle it with giveaway that the super rich don't need while deny a break to middle class family who do this year we have a opportunity to change that let's close loophole so we stop reward company that keep profit abroad and reward that that invest here in america let's use that saving to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it much attractive for company to bring job home let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file base on her actual bank statement instead of the numb of accountant she can afford and let's close the loophole that lead to inequality by allow the top percent to avoid pay tax on their accumulate wealth we can use that money to help much family pay for childcare and send their kid to college we need a tax code that truly help work american try to get a leg up in the new economy and we can achieve that together we can achieve it together help hard work family make end meet give them the tool they need for good pay job in this new economy maintain the condition of growth and competitiveness this be where america need to go i believe it's where the american people want to go it will make our economy strong a year from now year from now and deep into the century ahead of course if there's one thing this new century have teach us it's that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenge beyond our shore my first duty as commander in chief be to defend the unite state of america in do so the question be not whether america lead in the world but how when we make rash decision react to the headline instead of use our head when the first response to a challenge be to send in our military then we risk get draw into unnecessary conflict and neglect the broad strategy we need for a safe much prosperous world that's what our enemy want us to do i believe in a smart kind of american leadership we lead good when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition build when we don't let our fear blind us to the opportunity that this new century present that's exactly what we're do right now and around the globe it be make a difference first we stand unite with people around the world who have be target by terrorist from a school in pakistan to the street of paris we will continue to hunt down terrorist and dismantle their network and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have do relentlessly since i take office to take out terrorist who pose a direct threat to us and our ally at the same time we've learn some costly lesson over the last year instead of american patrol the valley of afghanistan we've train their security force who have now take the lead and we've honor our troop sacrifice by support that country's first democratic transition instead of send large grind force overseas we're partner with nation from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorist who threaten america in iraq and syria american leadership include our military power be stop isil's advance instead of get drag into another grind war in the middle east we be lead a broad coalition include arab nation to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group we're also support a moderate opposition in syria that can help us in this effort and assist people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism now this effort will take time it will require focus but we will succeed and tonight i call on this congress to show the world that we be unite in this mission by pass a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil we need that authority 2 we're demonstrate the power of american strength and diplomacy we're uphold the principle that big nation can't bully the small by oppose russian aggression and support ukraine's democracy and reassure our nato ally last year as we be do the hard work of impose sanction along with our ally as we be reinforce our presence with frontline state mr putin's aggression it be suggest be a masterful display of strategy and strength that's what i hear from some folk good today it be america that stand strong and unite with our ally while russia be isolate with its economy in tatter that's how america lead not with bluster but with persistent steady resolve in cuba we be end a policy that be long past its expiration date when what you're do doesn't work for year it's time to try something new and our shift in cuba policy have the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere it remove a phony excuse for restriction in cuba it stand up for democratic value and extend the hand of friendship to the cuban people and this year congress should begin the work of end the embargo as his holiness pope francis have say diplomacy be the work of small step and this small step have add up to new hope for the future in cuba and after year in prison we be overjoyed that alan gross be back where he belong welcome home alan we're glad you're here our diplomacy be at work with respect to iran where for the first time in a decade we've halt the progress of its nuclear program and reduce its stockpile of nuclear material between now and this spring we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevent a nuclear arm iran secure america and our ally include israel while avoid yet another middle east conflict there be no guarantee that negotiation will succeed and i keep all option on the table to prevent a nuclear iran but new sanction pass by this congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fail alienate america from its ally make it hard to maintain sanction and ensure that iran start up its nuclear program again it doesn't make sense and that's why i will veto any new sanction bill that threaten to undo this progress the american people expect us only to go to war as a last resort and i intend to stay true to that wisdom 3 we're look beyond the issue that have consume us in the past to shape the come century no foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our network steal our trade secret or invade the privacy of american family especially our kid so we're make sure our government integrate intelligence to combat cyber threat just as we have do to combat terrorism and tonight i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to good meet the evolve threat of cyber attack combat identity theft and protect our children's information that should be a bipartisan effort if we don't act we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable if we do we can continue to protect the technology that have unleash untold opportunity for people around the globe in west africa our troop our scientist our doctor our nurse our health care worker be roll back ebola save countless life and stop the spread of disease i can not be proud of them and i thank this congress for your bipartisan support of their effort but the job be not yet do and the world need to use this lesson to build a much effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemic invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty in the asia pacific we be modernize alliance while make sure that other nation play by the rule in how they trade how they resolve maritime dispute how they participate in meet common international challenge like nonproliferation and disaster relief and no challenge no challenge pose a great threat to future generation than climate change two thousand fourteen be the planet's warm year on record now year doesn't make a trend but this do of the warm year on record have all fall in the first year of this century now i've hear some folk try to dodge the evidence by say they're not scientist that we don't have enough information to act good i'm not a scientist either but you know what i know a lot of really good scientist at nasa and at noaa and at our major university and the good scientist in the world be all tell us that our activity be change the climate and if we don't act forcefully we'll continue to see rise ocean long hot heat wave dangerous drought and flood and massive disruption that can trigger great migration and conflict and hunger around the globe the pentagon say that climate change pose immediate risk to our national security we should act like it and that's why over the past year we've do much than ever to combat climate change from the way we produce energy to the way we use it that's why we've set aside much public land and water than any administration in history and that's why i will not let this congress endanger the health of our child by turn back the clock on our effort i be determine to make sure that american leadership drive international action in beijing we make a historic announcement the unite state will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution and china commit for the first time to limit their emission and because the world's two large economy come together other nation be now step up and offer hope that this year the world will finally reach a agreement to protect the one planet we've get and there's one last pillar of our leadership and that's the example of our value as american we respect human dignity even when we're threaten which be why i have prohibit torture and work to make sure our use of new technology like drone be properly constrain it's why we speak out against the deplorable anti semitism that have resurface in certain part of the world it's why we continue to reject offensive stereotype of muslim the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace that's why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoner and condemn the persecution of woman or religious minority or people who be lesbian gay bisexual or transgender we do this thing not only because they be the right thing to do but because ultimately they will make us safe as american we have a profound commitment to justice so it make no sense to spend million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemn and terrorist use to recruit since i've be president we've work responsibly to cut the population of gitmo in half now it be time to finish the job and i will not relend in my determination to shut it down it be not who we be it's time to close gitmo as american we cherish our civil liberty and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other country and industry in our fight against terrorist network so while some have move on from the debate over our surveillance program i have not as promise our intelligence agency have work hard with the recommendation of privacy advocate to increase transparency and build much safeguard against potential abuse and next month we'll issue a report on how we're keep our promise to keep our country safe while strengthen privacy look to the future instead of the past make sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely build coalition to meet new challenge and opportunity lead always with the example of our value that's what make us exceptional that's what keep us strong that's why we have to keep strive to hold ourselves to the high of standard our own you know just over a decade ago i give a speech in boston where i say there wasn't a liberal america or a conservative america a black america or a white america but a unite state of america i say this because i have see it in my own life in a nation that give someone like me a chance because i grow up in hawaii a melt pot of race and custom because i make illinois my home a state of small town rich farmland one of the world's great city a microcosm of the country where democrat and republican and independent good people of every ethnicity and every faith share certain bedrock value over the past year the pundit have point out much than once that my presidency hasn't deliver on this vision how ironic they say that our politic seem much divide than ever it's hold up as proof not just of my own flaw of which there be many but also as proof that the vision itself be misguide naive that there be too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it i know how tempt such cynicism may be but i still think the cynic be wrong i still believe that we be one people i still believe that together we can do great thing even when the odd be long i believe this because over and over in my year in office i have see america at its good i've see the hopeful face of young graduate from new york to california and our new officer at west point annapolis colorado spring new london i've mourn with grieve family in tucson and newtown in boston in west texas and west virginia i've watch american beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the great plain from midwest assembly line to the mid atlantic seaboard i've see something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue use to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country a civil right now legal in state that in american call home so i know the good and optimistic and big hearted generosity of the american people who every day live the idea that we be our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper and i know they expect that of us who serve here to set a good example so the question for that of us here tonight be how we all of us can good reflect america's hope i've serve in congress with many of you i know many of you good there be a lot of good people here on both side of the aisle and many of you have tell me that this isn't what you sign up for argue past each other on cable show the constant fundraising always look over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision imagine if we break out of this tire old pattern imagine if we do something different understand a good politic isn't one where democrat abandon their agendum or republican simply embrace mine a good politic be one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our base fear a good politic be one where we debate without demonize each other where we talk issue and value and principle and fact rather than gotcha moment or trivial gaffe or fake controversy that have nothing to do with people's daily life a politic a good politic be one where we spend little time drown in dark money for ad that pull us into the gutter and spend much time lift young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility ask them to join in the great mission of build america if we're go to have argument let's have argument but let's make them debate worthy of this body and worthy of this country we still may not agree on a woman's right to choose but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancy and abortion be near alltime low and that every woman should have access to the health care that she need yes passion still fly on immigration but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the strive young student and agree that no one benefit when a hard work mom be snatch from her child and that it's possible to shape a law that uphold our tradition as a nation of law and a nation of immigrant i've talk to republican and democrat about that that's something that we can share we may go at it in campaign season but surely we can agree that the right to vote be sacred that it's be deny to too many and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the vote right act we can come together democrat and republican to make vote easy for every single american we may have different take on the event of ferguson and new york but surely we can understand a father who fear his son can't walk home without be harass and surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she marry walk through the front door at the end of his shift and surely we can agree that it's a good thing that for the first time in year the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together and use that as a start point for democrat and republican community leader and law enforcement to reform america's criminal justice system so that it protect and serve all of us that's a good politic that's how we start rebuild trust that's how we move this country forward that's what the american people want and that's what they deserve i have no much campaign to run my only agendum audience member the president i know because i win both of them my only agendum for the next year be the same as the one i've have since the day i swear a oath on the step of this capitol to do what i believe be good for america if you share the broad vision i outline tonight i ask you to join me in the work at hand if you disagree with part of it i hope you'll at less work with me where you do agree and i commit to every republican here tonight that i will not only seek out your idea i will seek to work with you to make this country strong because i want this chamber i want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spot and shortcoming we be a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divide to unite in common effort to help our neighbor whether down the street or on the other side of the world i want our action to tell every child in every neighborhood your life matter and we be commit to improve your life chance as commit as we be to work on behalf of our own kid i want future generation to know that we be a people who see our difference as a great gift that we're a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman young and old black and white latino asian immigrant native american gay straight american with mental illness or physical disability everybody matter i want them to grow up in a country that show the world what we still know to be true that we be still much than a collection of red state and blue state that we be the unite state of america i want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sum up this past year it's amaze what you can bounce back from when you have to we be a strong tight knit family who's make it through some very very hard time my fellow american we too be a strong tight knit family we too have make it through some hard time fifteen year into this new century we have pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remake america we have lay a new foundation a bright future be ours to write let's begin this new chapter together and let's start the work right now thank you god bless you god bless this country we love thank you thank you mr speaker mr vice president member of congress my fellow american tonight mark the 8 year that i've come here to report on the state of the union and for this final one i'm go to try to make it a little short i know some of you be antsy to get back to iowa i've be there i'll be shake hand afterwards if you want some tip now i understand that because it's a election season expectation for what we will achieve this year be low but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leader take at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cut permanent for work family so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priority like criminal justice reform and help people who be battle prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse so who know we may surprise the cynic again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposal for the year ahead don't worry i've get plenty from help student learn to write computer code to personalize medical treatment for patient and i will keep push for progress on the work that i believe still need to be do fix a break immigration system protect our kid from gun violence equal pay for equal work pay leave raise the minimum wage all this thing still matter to hard work family they're still the right thing to do and i won't let up until they get do but for my final address to this chamber i don't want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next year the next year and beyond i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change change that's reshape the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world it's change that promise amaze medical breakthrough but also economic disruption that strain work family it promise this education for girl in the much remote village but also connect terrorist plot a ocean away it's change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate america have be through big change before war and depression the influx of new immigrant worker fight for a fair deal movement to expand civil right each time there have be that who tell us to fear the future who claim we can slam the brake on change who promise to restore past glory if we just get some group or idea that be threaten america under control and each time we overcome that fear we do not in the word of lincoln adhere to the dogma of the quiet past instead we think anew and act anew we make change work for us always extend america's promise outward to the next frontier to much people and because we do because we see opportunity with a where other see peril we emerge strong and good than before what be true then can be true now our unique strength as a nation our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law this thing give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generation to come in fact it's in that spirit that we have make progress this past year that's how we recover from the bad economic crisis in generation that's how we reform our health care system and reinvent our energy sector that's how we deliver much care and benefit to our troop come home and our veteran that's how we secure the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress be not inevitable it's the result of choice we make together and we face such choice right now will we respond to the change of our time with fear turn inward as a nation turn against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we be in what we stand for in the incredible thing that we can do together so let's talk about the future and four big question that i believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next president be or who control the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shoot at opportunity and security in this new economy 2 how do we make technology work for us and not against us especially when it come to solve urgent challenge like climate change 3 how do we keep america safe and lead the world without become its policeman and finally how can we make our politic reflect what's good in us and not what's bad let me start with the economy and a basic fact the unite state of america right now have the strong much durable economy in the world we're in the middle of the long streak of private sector job creation in history much than million new job the strong year of job growth since the 1990s a unemployment rate cut in half our auto industry just have its good year ever that's just part of a manufacture surge that's create nearly new job in the past year and we've do all this while cut our deficit by almost three quarter anyone claim that america's economy be in decline be peddle fiction now what be true and the reason that a lot of american feel anxious be that the economy have be change in profound way change that start long before the great recession hit change that have not let up today technology doesn't just replace job on the assembly line but any job where work can be automate company in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tough competition as a result worker have little leverage for a raise company have little loyalty to their community and much and much wealth and income be concentrate at the very top all this trend have squeeze worker even when they have job even when the economy be grow it's make it hard for a hard work family to pull itself out of poverty hard for young people to start their career tough for worker to retire when they want to and although none of this trend be unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who work hard should get a fair shoot for the past year our goal have be a grow economy that also work good for everybody we've make progress but we need to make much and despite all the political argument that we've have this past few year there be actually some area where american broadly agree we agree that real opportunity require every american to get the education and train they need to land a good pay job the bipartisan reform of no child leave behind be a important start and together we've increase early childhood education lift high school graduation rate to new high boost graduate in field like engineer in the come year we should build on that progress by provide pre k for all and offer every student the hand on computer science and math class that make them job ready on day one we should recruit and support much great teacher for our kid and we have to make college affordable for every american no hard work student should be stick in the red we've already reduce student loan payment by to percent of a borrower's income and that's good but now we've actually get to cut the cost of college provide year of community college at no cost for every responsible student be one of the good way to do that and i'm go to keep fight to get that start this year it's the right thing to do but a great education isn't all we need in this new economy we also need benefit and protection that provide a basic measure of security it's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who be go to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for year be sit in this chamber for everyone else especially folk in their forty and fifty save for retirement or bounce back from job loss have get a lot tough american understand that at some point in their career in this new economy they may have to retool they may have to retrain but they shouldn't lose what they've already work so hard to build in the process that's why social security and medicare be much important than ever we shouldn't weaken them we should strengthen them and for american short of retirement basic benefit should be just as mobile as everything else be today that by the way be what the affordable care act be all about it's about fill the gap in employer base care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business you'll still have coverage nearly million people have gain coverage so far and in the process health care inflation have slow and our business have create job every single month since it become law now i'm guess we won't agree on health care anytime soon but a little applause back there just a guess but there should be other way party can work together to improve economic security say a hard work american lose his job we shouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourage him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him if that new job doesn't pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bill and even if he's go from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his saving with him that's the way we make the new economy work good for everybody i also know speaker ryan have talk about his interest in tackle poverty america be about give everybody will to work a chance a hand up and i'd welcome a serious discussion about strategy we can all support like expand tax cut for low income worker who don't have child but there be some area where we just have to be honest it have be difficult to find agreement over the last year and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in make sure the system's not rig in favor of the wealthy and big corporation and it's a honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thrive private sector be the lifeblood of our economy i think there be outdate regulation that need to be change there be redtape that need to be cut there you go yes see but after year now of record corporate profit work family won't get much opportunity or big paycheck just by let big bank or big oil or hedge fund make their own rule at everybody else's expense middle class family be not go to feel much secure because we allow attack on collective bargain to go unanswered food stamp recipient do not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street do immigrant aren't the principal reason wage haven't go up that decision be make in the boardroom that all too often put quarterly earnings over long term return it's sure not the average family watch tonight that avoid pay tax through offshore account the point be i believe that in this new economy worker and startups and small business need much of a voice not little the rule should work for them and i'm not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many business who have figure out that do right by their worker or their customer or their community end up be good for their shareholder and i want to spread that good practice across america that's part of a bright future in fact it turn out many of our good corporate citizen be also our much creative and this bring me to the 2 big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our big challenge sixty year ago when the russian beat us into space we didn't deny sputnik be up there we didn't argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget we build a space program almost overnight and year late we be walk on the moon now that spirit of discovery be in our dna america be thomas edison and the wright brother and george washington carver america be grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america be every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley race to shape a good future that's who we be and over the past year we've nurture that spirit we've protect a open internet and take bold new step to get much student and low income american online we've launch next generation manufacture hub and online tool that give a entrepreneur everything he or she need to start a business in a single day but we can do so much much last year vice president biden say that with a new moonshot america can cure cancer last month he work with this congress to give scientist at the national institute of health the strong resource that they've have in over a decade good so tonight i'm announce a new national effort to get it do and because he's go to the mat for all of us on so many issue over the past year i'm putting joe in charge of mission control for the love one we've all lose for the family that we can still save let's make america the country that cure cancer once and for all what do you say joe let's make it happen now medical research be critical we need the same level of commitment when it come to develop clean energy source look if anybody still want to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because you'll be debate our military much of america's business leader the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and nation around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it but even if the planet wasn't at stake even if wasn't the warm year on record until turn out to be even hot why would we want to pass up the chance for american business to produce and sell the energy of the future listen year ago we make the single big investment in clean energy in our history here be the result in field from iowa to texas wind power be now cheap than dirty conventional power on rooftop from arizona to new york solar be save american ten of million of dollar a year on their energy bill and employ much american than coal in job that pay good than average we're take step to give homeowner the freedom to generate and store their own energy something by the way that environmentalist and tea partiers have team up to support and meanwhile we've cut our import of foreign oil by nearly percent and cut carbon pollution much than any other country on earth gas under buck a gallon ain't bad either now we've get to accelerate the transition away from old dirty energy source rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future especially in community that rely on fossil fuel we do them no favor when we don't show them where the trend be go and that's why i'm go to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resource so that they good reflect the cost they impose on taxpayer and our planet and that way we put money back into that community and put ten of thousand of american to work build a 21st century transportation system now none of this be go to happen overnight and yes there be plenty of entrench interest who want to protect the status quo but the job we'll create the money we'll save the planet we'll preserve that be the kind of future our kid and our grandkids deserve and it's within our grasp now climate change be just one of many issue where our security be link to the rest of the world and that's why the 3 big question that we have to answer together be how to keep america safe and strong without either isolate ourselves or try to nation build everywhere there's a problem now i tell you early all the talk of america's economic decline be political hot air good so be all the rhetoric you hear about our enemy get strong and america get weak let me tell you something the unite state of america be the much powerful nation on earth period period it's not even close it's not even close it's not even close we spend much on our military than the next eight nation combine our troop be the fine fight force in the history of the world all right no nation attack us directly or our ally because they know that's the path to ruin survey show our stand around the world be high than when i be elect to this office and when it come to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead they call us so i think it's useful to level set here because when we don't we don't make good decision now as someone who begin every day with a intelligence brief i know this be a dangerous time but that's not primarily because of some loom superpower out there and it's certainly not because of diminish american strength in today's world we're threaten little by evil empire and much by fail state the middle east be go through a transformation that will play out for a generation root in conflict that date back millennium economic headwind be blow in from a chinese economy that be in significant transition even as their economy severely contract russia be pour resource in to prop up ukraine and syria client state that they see slip away from their orbit and the international system we build after world war ii be now struggle to keep pace with this new reality it's up to us the unite state of america to help remake that system and to do that good it mean that we've get to set priority priority numb one be protect the american people and go after terrorist network both al qaida and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in today's world even a handful of terrorist who place no value on human life include their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the mind of individual inside our country their action undermine and destabilize our ally we have to take them out but as we focus on destroy isil over the top claim that this be world war iii just play into their hand mass of fighter on the back of pickup truck twist soul plot in apartment or garage they pose a enormous danger to civilian they have to be stop but they do not threaten our national existence that be the story isil want to tell that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we don't need to build them up to show that we're serious and we sure don't need to push away vital ally in this fight by echo the lie that isil be somehow representative of one of the world's large religion we just need to call them what they be killer and fanatic who have to be root out hunt down and destroy and that's exactly what we're do for much than a year america have lead a coalition of much than country to cut off isil's finance disrupt their plot stop the flow of terrorist fighter and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly airstrike we're take out their leadership their oil their train camp their weapon we're train arm and support force who be steadily reclaim territory in iraq and syria if this congress be serious about win this war and want to send a message to our troop and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote take a vote but the american people should know that with or without congressional action isil will learn the same lesson as terrorist before them if you doubt america's commitment or mine to see that justice be do just ask usama bin lade ask the leader of al qaida in yemen who be take out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attack who sit in a prison cell when you come after american we go after you and it may take time but we have long memory and our reach have no limit our foreign policy have to be focus on the threat from isil and al qaida but it can't stop there for even without isil even without al qaida instability will continue for decade in many part of the world in the middle east in afghanistan and part of pakistan in part of central america in africa and asia some of this place may become safe haven for new terrorist network other will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feed the next wave of refugee the world will look to us to help solve this problem and our answer need to be much than tough talk or call to carpet bomb civilian that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage we also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that fall into crisis even if it's do with the good of intention that's not leadership that's a recipe for quagmire spill american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us it's the lesson of vietnam it's the lesson of iraq and we should have learn it by now now fortunately there be a smart approach a patient and discipline strategy that use every element of our national power it say america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our ally but on issue of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other country pull their own weight that's our approach to conflict like syria where we're partner with local force and lead international effort to help that break society pursue a last peace that's why we build a global coalition with sanction and principled diplomacy to prevent a nuclear arm iran and as we speak iran have roll back its nuclear program ship out its uranium stockpile and the world have avoid another war that's how we stop the spread of ebola in west africa our military our doctor our development worker they be heroic they set up the platform that then allow other country to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundred of thousand maybe a couple million life be save that's how we forge a trans pacific partnership to open market and protect worker and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cut tax on product make in america which will then support much good job here in america with tpp china do not set the rule in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tool to enforce it it's the right thing to do let me give you another example fifty year of isolate cuba have fail to promote democracy it set us back in latin america that's why we restore diplomatic relation open the door to travel and commerce position ourselves to improve the life of the cuban people so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war be over lift the embargo the point be american leadership in the 21st century be not a choice between ignore the rest of the world except when we kill terrorist or occupy and rebuild whatever society be unravel leadership mean a wise application of military power and rally the world behind cause that be right it mean see our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly nation to the much ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that help vulnerable country but it also protect our kid when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decade long war that strengthen the international order we depend on when we help african country fee their people and care for the sick it's the right thing to do and it prevent the next pandemic from reach our shore right now we're on track to end the scourge of hiv aid that's within our grasp and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something i'll be push this congress to fund this year that's american strength that's american leadership and that kind of leadership depend on the power of our example that's why i will keep work to shut down the prison at guantanamo it be expensive it be unnecessary and it only serve as a recruitment brochure for our enemy there's a good way and that's why we need to reject any politic any politic that target people because of race or religion let me just say this this be not a matter of political correctness this be a matter of understand just what it be that make us strong the world respect us not just for our arsenal it respect us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis tell this body from the very spot that i'm stand on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrant and murderer be the good way to take their place when politician insult muslim whether abroad or our fellow citizen when a mosque be vandalize or a kid be call name that doesn't make us safe that's not tell it what tell it like it be it's just wrong it diminish us in the eye of the world it make it hard to achieve our goal it betray who we be as a country we the people our constitution begin with that three simple word word we've come to recognize mean all the people not just some word that insist we rise and fall together that that's how we may perfect our union and that bring me to the 4 and maybe much important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want all of us want opportunity and security for our family a rise standard of live a sustainable peaceful planet for our kid all that be within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debate it will only happen if we fix our politic a good politic doesn't mean we have to agree on everything this be a big country different region different attitude different interest that's one of our strength too our founder distribute power between state and branch of government and expect us to argue just as they do fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relation over the mean of liberty and the imperative of security but democracy do require basic bond of trust between its citizen it doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us be all motivate by malice it doesn't work if we think that our political opponent be unpatriotic or try to weaken america democracy grind to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic fact be contest or when we listen only to that who agree with us our public life wither when only the much extreme voice get all the attention and much of all democracy break down when the average person feel their voice doesn't matter that the system be rig in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many american feel that way right now it's one of the few regret of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the party have get bad instead of good i have no doubt a president with the gift of lincoln or roosevelt may have good bridge the divide and i guarantee i'll keep try to be good so long as i hold this office but my fellow american this cannot be my task or any president's alone there be a whole lot of folk in this chamber good people who would like to see much cooperation would like to see a much elevate debate in washington but feel trap by the imperative of get elect by the noise come out of your base i know you've tell me it's the bad keep secret in washington and a lot of you aren't enjoy be trap in that kind of rancor but that mean if we want a good politic and i'm address the american people now if we want a good politic it's not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our good self i think we've get to end the practice of draw our congressional district so that politician can pick their voter and not the other way around let a bipartisan group do it i believe we've get to reduce the influence of money in our politic so that a handful of family or hide interest can't bankroll our election and if our exist approach to campaign finance reform can't pass muster in the court we need to work together to find a real solution because it's a problem and much of you don't like raise money i know i've do it we've get to make it easy to vote not hard we need to modernize it for the way we live now this be america we want to make it easy for people to participate and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reform that do just that but i can't do this thing on my own change in our political process in not just who get elect but how they get elect that will only happen when the american people demand it it depend on you that's what's mean by a government of by and for the people what i'm suggest be hard it's a lot easy to be cynical to accept that change be not possible and politic be hopeless and the problem be all the folk who be elect don't care and to believe that our voice and our action don't matter but if we give up now then we forsake a good future that with money and power will gain great control over the decision that can send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal right and vote right that generation of american have fight even die to secure and then as frustration grow there will be voice urge us to fall back into our respective tribe to scapegoat fellow citizen who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we can't afford to go down that path it won't deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but much of all it contradict everything that make us the envy of the world so my fellow american whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you support my agendum or fight as hard as you can against it our collective future depend on your willingness to uphold your duty as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for other especially the weak especially the vulnerable know that each of us be only here because somebody somewhere stand up for us we need every american to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflect the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it be not easy our brand of democracy be hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no long hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspire by that voice of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that have help america travel so far voice that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native bear not democrat or republican but as american first bind by a common creed voice dr king believe would have the final word voice of unarmed truth and unconditional love and they're out there that voice they don't get a lot of attention they don't seek a lot of fanfare but they're busy do the work this country need do i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily act of citizenship i see our future unfold i see it in the worker on the assembly line who clock extra shift to keep his company open and the boss who pay him high wage instead of lay him off i see it in the dreamer who stay up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who come in early maybe with some extra supply that she buy because she know that that young girl may someday cure a disease i see it in the american who serve his time make bad mistake as a child but now be dream of start over and i see it in the business owner who give him that 2 chance the protester determine to prove that justice matter and the young cop walk the beat treat everybody with respect do the brave quiet work of keep us safe i see it in the soldier who give almost everything to save his brother the nurse who tend to him till he can run a marathon the community that line up to cheer him on it's the son who find the courage to come out as who he be and the father whose love for that son override everything he's be teach i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she have to the new citizen who cast his vote for the first time the volunteer at the poll who believe every vote should count because each of them in different way know how much that precious right be worth that's the america i know that's the country we love clear eye big hearted undaunted by challenge optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word that's what make me so hopeful about our future i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and that's why i stand here as confident as i have ever be that the state of our union be strong thank you god bless you god bless the unite state of america thank you thank you very much mr speaker mr vice president member of congress the first lady of the unite state and citizen of america tonight as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of black history month we be remind of our nation's path towards civil right and the work that still remain to be do recent threat target

will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our found year since the day we declare our independence it will be one of the great milestone in the history of the world but what will america look like as we reach our 250th year what kind of country will we leave for our child i will not allow the mistake of recent decade past to define the course of our future for too long we've watch our middle class shrink as we've export our job and wealth to foreign country we've finance and build one global project after another but ignore the fate of our child in the inner city of chicago baltimore detroit and so many other place throughout our land we've defend the border of other nation while leave our own border wide open for anyone to cross and for drug to pour in at a now unprecedented rate and we've spend trillion and trillion of dollar overseas while our infrastructure at home have so badly crumble then in the earth shift beneath our foot the rebellion start as a quiet protest speak by family of all color and creed family who just want a fair shoot for their child and a fair hear for their concern but then the quiet voice become a loud chorus as thousand of citizen now speak out together from city small and large all across our country finally the chorus become a earthquake and the people turn out by the ten of million and they be all unite by one very simple but crucial demand that america must put its own citizen first because only then can we truly make america great again dying industry will come roar back to life heroic veteran will get the care they so desperately need our military will be give the resource its brave warrior so richly deserve crumble infrastructure will be replace with new road bridge tunnel airport and railway gleam across our very

nearly billion dollar and overseas we have inherit a series of tragic foreign policy disaster solve this and so many other press problem will require us to work past the difference of party it will require us to tap into the american spirit that have overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history but to accomplish our goal at home and abroad we must restart the engine of the american economy make it easy for company to do business in the unite state and much much hard for company to leave our country right now american company be tax at one of the high rate anywhere in the world my economic team be develop historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our company so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone it will be a big big cut at the same time we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class we must create a level play field for american company and our worker we have to do it currently when we ship product out of america many other country make us pay very high tariff and tax but when foreign company ship their product into america we charge them nothing or almost nothing i just meet with official and worker from a great american company harley davidson in fact they proudly display five of their magnificent motorcycle make in the usa on the front lawn of the white house and they want me to ride one and i say no thank you at our meet i ask them how be you do how be business they say that it's good i ask them far how be you do with other country mainly international sale they tell me without even complain because they have be so mistreat for so long that they've become use to it that it's very hard to do business with other country because they tax our good at such a high rate they say that in the case of another country they tax their motorcycle at percent they weren't even ask for a change but i be i believe strongly in free trade but it also have to be fair trade it's be a long time since we have fair trade the first republican president abraham lincoln warn that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government will produce want and ruin among our people lincoln be right and it's time we heed his advice and his word i be not go to let america and its great company and worker be take advantage of us any long they have take advantage of our country no long i be go to bring back million of job protect our worker also mean reform our system of legal immigration the current outdate system depress wage for our poor worker and put great pressure on taxpayer nation around the world like canada australia and many other have a merit base immigration system it's a basic principle that that seek to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially yet in america we do not enforce this rule strain the very public resource that our poor citizen rely upon accord to the national academy of science our current immigration system cost american taxpayer many billion of dollar a year switch away from this current system of low skill immigration and instead adopt a merit base system we will have so many much benefit it will save countless dollar raise worker wage and help struggle family include immigrant family enter the middle class and they will do it quickly and they will be very very happy indeed i believe that real and positive immigration reform be possible as long as we focus on the follow goal to improve job and wage for american to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our law if we be guide by the wellbeing of american citizen then i believe republican and democrat can work together to achieve a outcome that have elude our country for decade another republican president dwight have eisenhower initiate the last truly great national infrastructure program the build of the interstate highway system the time have come for a new program of national rebuild america have spend approximately trillion in the middle east all the while our infrastructure at home be crumble with this trillion we can have rebuild our country twice and maybe even three time if we have people who have the ability to negotiate to launch our national rebuild i will be ask congress to approve legislation that produce a trillion investment in infrastructure of the unite state finance through both public and private capital create million of new job this effort will be guide by two core principle buy american and hire american tonight i be also call on this congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reform that expand choice increase access low cost and at the same time provide good healthcare mandate every american to buy government approve health insurance be never the right solution for our country the way to make health insurance available to everyone be to low the cost of health insurance and that be what we be go do obamacare premium nationwide have increase by double and triple digit as a example arizona go up percent last year alone governor matt bevin of kentucky just say obamacare be fail in his state the state of kentucky and it's unsustainable and collapse one 3 of county have only one insurer and they be lose them fast they be lose them so fast they be leave and many american have no choice at all there's no choice leave remember when you be tell that you can keep your doctor and keep your plan we now know that all of that promise have be totally break obamacare be collapse and we must act decisively to protect all american action be not a choice it be a necessity so i be call on all democrat and republican in congress to work with us to save american from this implode obamacare disaster here be the principle that should guide the congress as we move to create a good healthcare system for all american first we should ensure that american with preexist condition have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for american currently enroll in the healthcare exchange secondly we should help american purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credit and expand health saving account but it must be the plan they want not the plan force on them by our government thirdly we should give our great state governor the resource and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one be leave out 4 we should implement legal reform that protect patient and doctor from unnecessary cost that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drug and bring them down immediately and finally the time have come to give american the freedom to purchase health insurance across state line which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far good care so important everything that be break in our country can be fix every problem can be solve and every hurt family can find heal and hope our citizen deserve this and so much much so why not join force and finally get the job do and get it do right on this and so many other thing democrat and republican should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the american people my administration want to work with member of both party to make childcare accessible and affordable to help ensure new parent that they have pay family leave to invest in women's health and to promote clean air and clean water and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure true love for our people require us to find common grind to advance the common good and to cooperate on behalf of

notre dame megan's story be about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keep too many advance like the one that save megan's life from reach that in need if we slash the restraint not just at the fda but across our government then we will be bless with far much miracle just like megan in fact our child will grow up in a nation of miracle but to achieve this future we must enrich the mind and the soul of every american child education be the civil right issue of our time i be call upon member of both party to pass a education bill that fund school choice for disadvantage youth include million of african american and latino child this family should be free to choose the public private charter magnet religious or home school that be right for them join us tonight in the gallery be a remarkable woman denisha merriweather as a young girl denisha struggle in school and fail 3 grade twice but

poverty we must also break the cycle of violence the murder rate in experience its large single year increase in nearly half a century in chicago much than people be shoot last year alone and the murder rate so far this year have be even high this be not acceptable in our society every american child should be able to grow up in a safe community to attend a great school and to have access to a high pay job but to create this future we must work with not against not against the man and woman of law enforcement we must build bridge of cooperation and trust not drive the wedge of disunity and

recent month my administration have meet extensively with both democrat and republican to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform base on this discussion we present congress with a detail proposal that should be support by both party as a fair compromise one where nobody get everything they want but where our country get the critical reform it need and must have here be the four pillar of our plan the first pillar of our framework generously offer a path to citizenship for million illegal immigrant who be bring here by their parent at a young age that cover almost three time much people than the previous administration cover under our plan that who meet education and work requirement and show good moral character will be able to become full citizen of the unite state over a year period the 2 pillar fully secure the border that mean build a great wall on the southern border and it mean hire much hero like cj to keep our community safe crucially our plan close the terrible loophole exploit by criminal and terrorist to enter our country and it finally end the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release the 3 pillar end the visa lottery a program that randomly hand out green card without any regard for skill merit or the safety of american people it's time to begin move towards a merit base immigration system one that admit people who be skill who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country the 4 and final pillar protect the nuclear family by end chain migration under the current break system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited number of distant relative under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limit sponsorships to spouse and minor child this vital reform be necessary not just for our economy but for our security and for the future of america in recent week two terrorist attack in new york be make possible by the visa lottery and chain migration in the age of terrorism this program present risk we can just no long afford it's time to reform this outdate immigration rule and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century this four pillar represent a down the middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system for over year washington have try and fail to solve this problem this congress can be the one that finally make it happen much importantly this four pillar will produce legislation that fulfill my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that put america first so let's come together set politic aside and finally get the job do this reform will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction never before have it be like it be now it be terrible we have to do something about it in we lose american to drug overdose death per day per hour we must get much tough on drug dealer and pusher if we be go to succeed in stop this scourge my administration be commit to fight the drug epidemic and help get treatment for that in need for that who have be so terribly hurt the struggle will be long and it will be difficult but as american always do in the end we will succeed we will prevail as we have see tonight the much difficult challenge bring out the good in america we see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the holets family of new mexico ryan holets be year old a officer with the albuquerque police department he's here tonight with his wife rebecca thank you ryan last year ryan be on duty when he see a pregnant homeless woman prepare to inject heroin when ryan tell her she be go to harm her unborn child she begin to weep she tell him she didn't know where to turn but badly want a safe home for her baby in that moment ryan say he feel god speak to him you will do it because you can he hear that word he take out a picture of his wife and their four kid then he go home to tell his wife rebecca in a instant she agree to adopt the holets name their new daughter hope ryan and rebecca you embody the goodness of our nation thank you thank you ryan and rebecca as we rebuild america's strength and confidence at home we be also restore our strength and stand abroad around the world we face rogue regime terrorist group and rival like china and russia that challenge our interest our economy and our value in confront this horrible danger we know that weakness be the sure path to conflict and unmatched power be the sure mean to our true and great defense for this reason i be ask congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military as part of our defense we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never have to use it but make it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any act of aggression by any other nation or anyone else perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the country of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapon unfortunately we be not there yet sadly last year i also pledge that we would work with our ally to extinguish isis from the face of the earth one year late i be proud to report that the coalition to defeat isis have liberate very close to percent of the territory just recently hold by this killer in iraq and in syria and in other location as good but there be much much work to be do we will

building that isis have rig with explosive so that civilian can return to that city hopefully soon and hopefully safely clear the 2 floor of a vital hospital kenton stacy be severely wound by a explosion immediately justin bound into the booby trap and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe build and find kenton but in very very bad shape he apply pressure to the wind and insert a tube to reopen a airway he then perform cpr for straight minute during the grind transport and maintain artificial respiration through two and a half hour and through emergency surgery kenton stacy would have die if it be not for justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior tonight kenton be recover in texas raqqa be liberate and justin be wear his new bronze star with a v for valor staff sergeant peck all of america salute you terrorist who do thing like place bomb in civilian hospital be evil when possible we have no choice but to annihilate them when necessary we must be able to detain and question them but we must be clear terrorist be not merely criminal they be unlawful enemy combatant and when capture overseas they should be treat like the terrorist they be in the past we have foolishly release hundred and hundred of dangerous terrorist only to meet them again on the battlefield include the isis leader al baghdadi who we capture who we have who we release so today i'm keep another promise i just sign prior to walk in a order direct secretary mattis who be do a great job thank you to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facility in guantanamo bay i be ask congress to ensure that in the fight against isis and al qaeda we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorist wherever we chase them down wherever we find them and in many case for them
