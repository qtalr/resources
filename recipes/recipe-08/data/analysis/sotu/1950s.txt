right here i want to say that no one appreciate much than i the bipartisan cooperation in foreign affair which have be enjoy by this administration our success in work with other nation to achieve

institution public and private we can achieve peace only if we maintain our productive energy our democratic institution and our firm belief in individual freedom our sure guide in the day that lie ahead will be the spirit in which this great republic be round we must make our decision in the conviction that all man be create equal that they be equally entitle to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that the duty of government be to serve this end this country of ours have experience many blessing but none great than its dedication to this principle at every point in our history this ideal have serve to correct our failure and shortcoming to spur us on to great effort and to keep clearly before us the primary purpose of our existence as a nation they have enshrine for us a principle of government the moral imperative to do justice and the divine command to man to love one another this principle give mean to all that we do in foreign policy they mean that we can never be tolerant of oppression or tyranny they mean that we must throw our weight on the side of great freedom and a good life for all people this principle confirm us in carry out the specific program for peace which we have already begin we shall continue to give our wholehearted support to the unite nation we believe that this organization can ultimately provide the framework of international law and morality without which mankind cannot survive it have already set up new standard for the conduct of nation in the declaration of human right and the convention on genocide it be move ahead to give mean to the concept of world brotherhood through a wide variety of cultural economic and technical activity the event of the past year again show the value of the unite nation in bring about the peaceful adjustment of tense international controversy in indonesia and in palestine the effort of the unite nation have put a stop to bloodshed and pave the way to peaceful settlement we be work toward the time when the unite nation will control weapon of mass destruction and will have the force to preserve international law and order while the world remain unsettle however and as long as our own security and the security of the free world require we will maintain a strong and good balance defense organization the selective service system be a essential part of our defense plan and it must be continue under the principle of the unite nation charter we must continue to share in the common defense of free nation against aggression at the last session this congress lay the basis for this joint effort we now must put into effect the common defense plan that be be work out we shall continue our effort for world economic recovery because world prosperity be the only sure foundation of a permanent peace as a immediate mean to this end we must continue our support of the european recovery program this program have achieve great success in the first year of its operation but it have not yet be complete if we be to stop this program now or cripple it just because it be succeed we should be do exactly what the enemy of democracy want us to do we should be just as foolish as a man who for reason of false economy fail to put a roof on his house after build the foundation and the wall world prosperity also require that we do all we can to expand world trade as a major step in this direction we should promptly join the international trade organization the purpose of this organization which the unite state have be foremost in create be to establish a code of fair practice and a international authority for adjust difference in international commercial relation it be a effort to prevent the kind of anarchy and irresponsibility in world trade which do so much to bring about the world depression of the s a expand world economy require the improvement of live standard and the development of resource in area where human poverty and misery now prevail without such improvement the recovery of europe and the future of our own economy will not be secure i urge that the congress adopt the legislation now before it to provide for increase the flow of technical assistance and capital investment in underdeveloped region it be much essential now than ever if the ideal of freedom and representative government be to prevail in this area and particularly in the far east that their people experience in their own life the benefit of scientific and economic advance this program will require the movement of large amount of capital from the industrial nation and particularly from the unite state to productive use in the underdeveloped area of the world recent world event make prompt action imperative this program be in the interest of all people and have nothing in common with either the old imperialism of the last century or the new imperialism of the communist our aim for a peaceful democratic world of free people will be achieve in the long run not by force of arm but by a appeal to the mind and heart of man if the peace policy of the democratic nation be to be successful they must demonstrate that the benefit of their way of life can be increase and extend to all nation and all race in the world today we be confront with the danger that the rise demand of people everywhere for freedom and a good life may be corrupt and betray by the false promise of communism in its ruthless struggle for power communism seize upon our imperfection and take advantage of the delay and setback which the democratic nation experience in their effort to secure a good life for their citizen this challenge to us be much than a military challenge it be a challenge to the honesty of our profession of the democratic faith it be a challenge to the efficiency and stability of our economic system it be a challenge to the willingness to work with other people for world peace and for world prosperity for my part i welcome that challenge i believe that our country at this crucial point in world history will meet that challenge successfully i believe that in cooperation with the other free nation of the world we shall extend the full benefit of the democratic way of life to million who do not now enjoy them and preserve mankind from dictatorship and tyranny i believe that we shall succeed in our struggle for this peace because i have see the success we have have in our own country in follow the principle of freedom over the last year the ideal of liberty and equal opportunity to which this nation be dedicate have be increasingly realize in the life of our people the ideal of equal opportunity no long mean simply the opportunity which a man have to advance beyond his fellow some of our citizen do achieve great success than other as a reward for individual merit and effort and this be as it should be at the same time our country must be much than a land of opportunity for a select few it must be a land of opportunity for all of us in such a land we can grow and prosper together the simple truth that we can all go forward together be often question by selfish or shortsighted person it be strange that this be so for this proposition be so clearly demonstrate by our national history during the last year for example our nation have grow enormously in material good be this growth have come about not by concentrate the benefit of our progress in the hand of a few but by increase the wealth of the great body of our nation and our citizen in the last year the income of the average family have increase so greatly that its buy power have double the average hour of work have decline from to a week the whole hourly production of the average worker have triple average wage allow for price change have increase from about cent a hour to a hour we have accomplish what to early age of mankind would have be a miracle we work short hour we produce much and we live good increase freedom from poverty and drudgery have give a full mean to american life our people be good educate we have much opportunity for travel and recreation and enjoyment of the art we enjoy much personal liberty in the unite state today than ever before if we can continue in the spirit of cooperative adventure which have mark the recent year of our progress we can expect far scientific advance far increase in our standard of live and a still wide enjoyment of democratic freedom no one of course can foretell the future exactly however if we assume that we shall grow as fast in the future as we have grow in the past we can get a good idea of how much our country should grow in the next year at present our total national production be billion a year our work population and our output per worker be increase if our productive power continue to increase at the same rate as it have increase over the past year our total national production year from now will be nearly four time as much as it be today allow for the expect growth in population this would mean that the real income of the average family in the year a.d would be about three time what it be today this be estimate of what we can do in the future but we can reach this height only if we follow the right policy we have learn by bitter experience that progress be not automatic that wrong policy lead to depression and disaster we cannot achieve this gain unless we have a stable economy and avoid the catastrophe of boom and bust that have set us back in the past this gain cannot be achieve unless our businessman maintain their spirit of initiative and enterprise and operate in a competitive economy they cannot be achieve unless our workingman and woman and their union help to increase productivity and obtain for labor a fair share of the benefit of our economic system they cannot be achieve unless we have a stable and prosperous agriculture they cannot be achieve unless we conserve and develop our natural resource in the public interest our system will not work unless our people be healthy good educate and confident of the future it will not work unless all citizen can participate fully in our national life in achieve this gain the government have a special responsibility to help create and maintain the condition which will permit the growth we know be possible foremost among this condition be the need for a fair distribution of our increase prosperity among all the great group of our population who help to bring it about labor business agriculture businessman must continue to have the incentive necessary for investment and for the development of new line of enterprise in the future growth of this country lie possibility for hundred of thousand of new and independent business as our national production increase as it double and redouble in the next year the numb of independent and compete enterprise should also increase if the numb do not increase our constantly grow economy will fall under the control of a few dominant economic group whose power will be so great that they will be a challenge to democratic institution to avoid this danger we must curb monopoly and provide aid to independent business so that it may have the credit and capital to compete in a system of free enterprise i recommend that the congress complete action at this session on the pend bill to close the loophole in the clayton act which now permit monopolistic merger i also hope before this session be over to transmit to the congress a series of proposal to strengthen the antimonopoly law to assist small business and to encourage the growth of new enterprise in the case of labor free collective bargain must be protect and encourage collective bargain be not only a fundamental economic freedom for labor it be also a strengthen and stabilize influence for our whole economy the federal statute now govern labor relation be punitive in purpose and one side in operation this statute be and always have be inconsistent with the practice of true and effective collective bargain it should be repeal and replace by a law that be fair to all and in harmony with our democratic ideal a full understand of the problem of modern labor relation be of such importance that i recommend the establishment of a labor extension service to encourage educational activity in this field another essential for our continue growth be a stable and prosperous agriculture for many year we have be build a program to give the farmer a reasonable measure of protection against the special hazard to which he be expose that program be improve at the last session of the congress however our farm legislation be still not adequate although the congress have properly declare as a matter of national policy that safeguard must be maintain against slump in farm price there be serious shortcoming in the method now available for carry out this policy mandatory price support should be provide for the commodity not now cover which be major source of farm income moreover we should provide a method of support farm income at fair level which will at the same time avoid pile up unmanageable surplus and allow consumer to obtain the full benefit of our abundant agricultural production a system of production payment give the great promise of accomplish this purpose i recommend that the use of such a system be authorize one of the much important factor in our continue growth be the construction of much good up to date house in a country such as ours there be no reason why decent home should not be within the reach of all with the help of various government program we have make great progress in the last few year in increase the numb of home despite this increase there be still a acute shortage of house for the low and middle income group especially in large metropolitan area we have lay the groundwork for relieve the plight of low income family in the house act of to aid the middle income family i recommend that the congress enact new legislation authorize a vigorous program to help cooperative and other nonprofit group build house which this family can afford rend control have do a great deal to prevent the house shortage from have have bad effect during this postwar period of adjustment rend control be still necessary to prevent widespread hardship and sharp curtailment of the buy power of million of consumer in metropolitan area i recommend therefore that rend control be continue for another year if we be to achieve a good life for all the natural resource of the country must be regard as a public trust we must use our precious asset of soil water and forest and grassland in such a way that they become constantly much productive and much valuable government investment in the conservation and development of our resource be necessary to the future economic expansion of the country we need to enlarge the production and transmission of public power that be true not only in that region which have already receive great benefit from federal power project but also in region such as new england where the benefit of large scale public power development have not yet be experience in our hydroelectric and irrigation undertaking as good as in our other resource program we must continue policy to assure that their benefit will be spread among the many and not restrict to the favor few important resource legislation which should be pass at this session include the authorization of the st lawrence seaway and power project and the establishment of the columbia valley administration the establishment of the columbia valley administration i don't want you to miss that through wise government policy and government expenditure for the conservation and development of our natural resource we can be sure of transmit to our child and our children's child a country far rich and much productive than the one we know today the value of our natural resource be constantly be increase by the progress of science research be find new way of use such natural asset as mineral sea water and plant life in the peaceful development of atomic energy particularly we stand on the threshold of new wonder the first experimental machine for produce useful power from atomic energy be now under construction we have make only the first beginning in this field but in the perspective of history they may loom large than the first airplane or even the first tool that start man on the road to civilization to take full advantage of the increase possibility of nature we must equip ourselves with increase knowledge government have a responsibility to see that our country maintain its position in the advance of science as a step toward this end the congress should complete action on the measure to create a national science foundation another duty of the government be to promote the economic security the health and the education of its citizen by so do we strengthen both our economy and the structure of our society in a nation as rich as ours all citizen should be able to live in decency and health our social security system should be develop into the main reliance of our people for basic protection against the economic hazard of old age unemployment and illness i earnestly hope that the congress will complete action at this session on legislation to increase the benefit and extend the coverage of old age and survivor insurance the widespread movement to provide pension in private industry dramatize the need for improvement in the public insurance system i also urge that the congress strengthen our unemployment compensation law to meet present day need much adequately the economic downturn of the past year be the first real test that our system of unemployment insurance have have to meet that test have prove the wisdom of the system but it have also make strikingly apparent the need for improve its operation and increase its coverage and its benefit in the field of health there be immense opportunity to extend to much of our people the benefit of the amaze advance in medical science we have make a good begin in expand our hospital but we must also go on to remedy the shortage of doctor nurse and public health service and to establish a system of medical insurance which will enable all american to afford good medical care we must take immediate step to strengthen our educational system in many part of our country young people be be handicap for life because of a poor education the rapidly increase numb of child of school age couple with the shortage of qualify teacher make this problem much critical each year i believe that the congress should no long delay in provide federal assistance to the state so that they can maintain adequate school as we go forward in achieve great economic security and great opportunity for all our people we should make every effort to extend the benefit of our democratic institution to every citizen the religious ideal which we profess and the heritage of freedom which we have receive from the past clearly place that duty upon us i again urge the congress to enact the civil right proposal i make in february this proposal be for the enactment of federal statute which will protect all our people in the exercise of their democratic right and their search for economic opportunity grant statehood to alaska and hawaii provide a great measure of self government for our island possession and accord home rule to the district of columbia some of that proposal have be before the congress for a long time that who oppose them as good as that who favor them should recognize that it be the duty of the elect representative of the people to let this proposal come to a vote our democratic ideal as good as our good interest require that we do our fair share in provide home for the unfortunate victim of war and tyranny in so do we shall add strength to our democracy through the ability and skill which this man and woman will bring here i urge the prompt enactment by the congress of the legislation now before it to extend and broaden the exist displace person law and remove its discriminatory feature the measure i be recommend to the congress concern both our foreign and our domestic policy represent a carefully consider program to meet our national need it be a program which necessarily require large expenditure of fund much than percent of the government's expenditure be require to meet the cost of past war and to work for world peace this be the dominant factor in our fiscal policy at the same time the government must make substantial expenditure which be necessary to the growth and expansion of the domestic economy at present largely because of the ill consider tax reduction of the both congress the government be not receive enough revenue to meet its necessary expenditure to meet this situation i be propose that federal expenditure be hold to the low level consistent with our international requirement and the essential need of economic growth and the good be of our people i think i have good read that over you interrupt me in the middle to meet this situation i be propose that federal expenditure be hold to the low level consistent with our international requirement and the essential need of economic growth and the good be of our people don't forget that last phrase at the same time we must guard against the folly of attempt budget slash which would impair our prospect for peace or cripple the program essential to our national strength the budget recommendation i shall shortly transmit to the congress show that we can expect a substantial improvement in our fiscal position over the next few year as the cost of some of our extraordinary postwar program decline and as the government revenue rise as a result of growth in employment and national income to far improve our fiscal outlook we should make some change in our tax system which will reduce present inequity stimulate business activity and yield a moderate amount of additional revenue i expect to transmit specific recommendation to the congress on this subject at a very early date the fiscal policy i be recommend be the quick and safe way of achieve a balance budget as we move forward into the 2 half of the 20th century we must always bear in mind the central purpose of our national life we do not seek material prosperity for ourselves because we love luxury we do not aid other nation because we wish to increase our power we have not devise program for the security and good be of our people because we be afraid or unwilling to take risk this be not the mean of our past history or our present course we work for a good life for all so that all man may put to good use the great gift with which they have be endow by their creator we seek to establish that material condition of life in which without exception man may live in dignity perform useful work serve their community and worship god as they see fit this may seem simple goal but they be not little one they be worth a great deal much than all the empire and conquest of history they be not to be achieve by military aggression or political fanaticism they be to be achieve by humble mean by hard work by a spirit of self restraint in our dealings with one another and by a deep devotion to the principle of justice and equality it should make us truly thankful as we look back to the beginning of this country that we have come so far along the road to a good life for all it should make us humble to think as we look ahead how much far we have to go to accomplish at home and abroad the objective that be set out for us at the found of this great nation as we approach the halfway mark of the 20th century we should ask for continue strength and guidance from that almighty power who have place before us such great opportunity for the good of mankind in the year to come mr president mr speaker member of the congress this 82d congress face as grave a task as any congress in the history of our republic the action you take will be watch by the whole world this action will measure the ability of a free people act through their choose representative and their free institution to meet a deadly challenge to their way of life we can meet this challenge foolishly or wisely we can meet it timidly or bravely shamefully or honorably i know that the 82d congress will meet this challenge in a way worthy of our great heritage i know that your debate will be earnest responsible constructive and to the point i know that from this debate there will come the great decision need to carry us forward at this critical time i be glad to say that our country be in a healthy condition our democratic institution be sound and strong we have much man and woman at work than ever before we be able to produce much than ever before in fact far much than any country ever produce in the history of the world i be confident that we can succeed in the great task that lie before us we will succeed but we must all do our part we must all act together as citizen of this great republic as we meet here today american soldier be fight a bitter campaign in korea we pay tribute to their courage devotion and gallantry our man be fight alongside their unite nation ally because they know as we do that the aggression in korea be part of the attempt of the russian communist dictatorship to take over the world step by step our man be fight a long way from home but they be fight for our life and our liberty they be fight to protect our right to meet here today our right to govern ourselves as a free nation the threat of world conquest by soviet russia endanger our liberty and endanger the kind of world in which the free spirit of man can survive this threat be aim at all people who strive to win or defend their own freedom and national independence indeed the state of our nation be in great part the state of our friend and ally throughout the world the gun that point at them point at us also the threat be a total threat and the danger be a common danger all free nation be expose and all be in peril their only security lie in band together no one nation can find protection in a selfish search for a safe haven from the storm the free nation do not have any aggressive purpose we want only peace in the world peace for all country no threat to the security of any nation be conceal in our plan and program we have hope that the soviet union with its security assure by the charter of the unite nation would be will to live and let live but i be sorry to say that have not be the case the imperialism of the czar have be replace by the even much ambitious much crafty and much menace imperialism of the ruler of the soviet union this new imperialism have powerful military force it be keep million of man under arm it have a large air force and a strong submarine force it have complete control of the man and equipment of its satellite it have keep its subject people and its economy in a state of perpetual mobilization the present ruler of the soviet union have show that they be will to use this power to destroy the free nation and win domination over the whole world the soviet imperialist have two way of go about their destructive work they use the method of subversion and internal revolution and they use the method of external aggression in preparation for either of this method of attack they stir up class strife and disorder they encourage sabotage they put out poisonous propaganda they deliberately try to prevent economic improvement if their effort be successful they foment a revolution as they do in czechoslovakia and china and as they try unsuccessfully to do in greece if their method of subversion be block and if they think they can get away with outright warfare they resort to external aggression this be what they do when they loose the army of their puppet state against the republic of korea in a evil war by proxy we of the free world must be ready to meet both of this method of soviet action we must not neglect one or the other the free world have power and resource to meet this two form of aggression resource that be far great than that of the soviet dictatorship we have skill and vigorous people great industrial strength and abundant source of raw material and above all we cherish liberty our common ideal be a great part of our strength this ideal be the drive force of human progress the free nation believe in the dignity and the worth of man we believe in independence for all nation we believe that free and independent nation can band together into a world order base on law we have lay the cornerstone of such a peaceful world in the unite nation we believe that such a world order can and should spread the benefit of modern science and industry good health and education much food and rise standard of live throughout the world this ideal give our cause a power and vitality that russian communism can never command the free nation however be bind together by much than ideal they be a real community bind together also by the tie of self interest and self preservation if they should fall apart the result would be fatal to human freedom our own national security be deeply involve with that of the other free nation while they need our support we equally need theirs our national safety would be gravely prejudice if the soviet union be to succeed in harness to its war machine the resource and the manpower of the free nation on the border of its empire if western europe be to fall to soviet russia it would double the soviet supply of coal and triple the soviet supply of steel if the free country of asia and africa should fall to soviet russia we would lose the source of many of our much vital raw material include uranium which be the basis of our atomic power and soviet command of the manpower of the free nation of europe and asia would confront us with military force which we can never hope to equal in such a situation the soviet union can impose its demand on the world without resort to conflict simply through the preponderance of its economic and military power the soviet union do not have to attack the unite state to secure domination of the world it can achieve its end by isolate us and swallow up all our ally therefore even if we be craven enough i do not believe we can be but i say even if we be craven enough to abandon our ideal it would be disastrous for us to withdraw from the community of free nation we be the much powerful single member of this community and we have a special responsibility we must take the leadership in meet the challenge to freedom and in help to protect the right of independent nation this country have a practical realistic program of action for meet this challenge first we shall have to extend economic assistance where it can be effective the good way to stop subversion by the kremlin be to strike at the root of social injustice and economic disorder people who have job home and hope for the future will defend themselves against the underground agent of the kremlin our program of economic aid have do much to turn back communism in europe the marshall plan have have a electrify result as european recovery progress the strike lead by the kremlin's agent in italy and france fail all over western europe the communist party take bad and bad beating at the poll the country which have receive marshall plan aid have be able through hard work to expand their productive strength in many case to level high than ever before in their history without this strength they would be completely incapable of defend themselves today they be now ready to use this strength in help to build a strong combine defense against aggression we shall need to continue some economic aid to european country this aid should now be specifically relate to the build of their defense in other part of the world our economic assistance will need to be much broadly direct toward economic development in the near east in africa in asia we must do what we can to help people who be strive to advance from misery poverty and hunger we must also continue to help the economic growth of our good neighbor in this hemisphere this action will bring great strength for the free world they will give many people a real stake in the future and reason to defend their freedom they will mean increase production of good they need and material we need 2 we shall need to continue our military assistance to country which want to defend themselves the heart of our common defense effort be the north atlantic community the defense of europe be the basis for the defense of the whole free world ourselves include next to the unite state europe be the large workshop in the world it be also a homeland of the great religious belief share by many of our citizen belief which be now threaten by the tide of atheistic communism strategically economically and morally the defense of europe be a part of our own defense that be why we have join with the country of europe in the north atlantic treaty pledge ourselves to work with them there have be much discussion recently over whether the european country be will to defend themselves their action be answer this question our north atlantic treaty partner have strict system of universal military train several have recently increase the term of service all have take measure to improve the quality of train force be be train and expand as rapidly as the necessary arm

mission be vital to our security we should all stand behind him and give him every bite of help we can part of our job will be to reinforce the military strength of our european partner by send them weapon and equipment as our military production expand our program of military assistance extend to the nation in the near east and the far east which be try to defend their freedom soviet communism be try to make this nation into colony and to use their people as cannon fodder in new war of conquest we want their people to be free man and to enjoy peace our country have always stand for freedom for the people of asia long long ago it stand for the freedom of the people of asia our history show this we have demonstrate it in the philippines we have demonstrate it in our relation with indonesia india and with china we hope to join in restore the people of japan to membership in the community of free nation it be in the far east that we have take up arm under the unite nation to preserve the principle of independence for free nation we be fight to keep the force of communist aggression from make a slave state out of korea korea have tremendous significance for the world it mean that free nation act through the unite nation be fight together against aggression we will understand the importance of this good if we look back into history if the democracy have stand up against the invasion of manchuria in or the attack on ethiopia in or the seizure of austria in if they have stand together against aggression on that occasion as the unite nation have do in korea the whole history of our time would have be different the principle for which we be fight in korea be right and just they be the foundation of collective security and of the future of free nation korea be not only a country undergo the torment of aggression it be also a symbol it stand for right and justice in the world against oppression and slavery the free world must always stand for this principle

great principle of international cooperation lay down in its charter we be will as we have always be to negotiate honorable settlement with the soviet union but we will not engage in appeasement the soviet ruler have make it clear that we must have strength as good as right on our side if we build our strength and we be build it the soviet ruler may face the fact and lie aside their plan to take over the world that be what we hope will happen and that be what we be try to bring about that be the only realistic road to peace this be the main element of the course our nation must follow as a member of the community of free nation this be the thing we must do to preserve our security and help create a peaceful world but they will be successful only if we increase the strength of our own country here at home we have some very big job to do we be build much strong military force and we be build them fast we be prepare for full wartime mobilization if that should be necessary and we be continue to build a strong and grow economy able to maintain whatever effort may be require for as long as necessary we be build our own army navy and air force to a active strength of nearly million man and woman we be step up the train of the reserve force and establish much train facility so that we can rapidly increase our active force far much on short notice we be go to produce all the weapon and equipment that such a arm force will need furthermore we will make weapon for our ally and weapon for our own reserve supply on top of this we will build the capacity to turn out on short notice arm and supply that may be need for a full scale war fortunately we have a good start on this because of our enormous plant capacity and because of the equipment on hand from the last war for example many combat ship be be return to active duty from the mothball fleet and many other can be put into service on very short notice we have large reserve of arm and ammunition and thousand of worker skill in arm production in many case however our stock of weapon be low in other case that on hand be not the much modern we have make remarkable technical advance we have develop new type of jet plane and powerful new tank we be concentrate on produce the new type of weapon and produce them as fast as we can this production drive be much selective than the one we have during world war ii but it be just as urgent and intense it be a big program and it be a costly one let me give you two concrete example our present program call for expand the aircraft industry so that it will have the capacity to produce modern military plane a year we be prepare the capacity to produce tank a year we be not now order that many plane or that many tank and we hope that we never have to but we mean to be able to turn them out if we need them the plane we be produce now be much big much good and much much expensive than the plane we have during the last war we use to think that the b be a huge plane and the blockbuster it carry a huge load but the b can carry five of this blockbuster in its belly and it can carry them five time as far of course the b be much much complicate to build than the b and far much expensive one b cost while now one b cost ѕ million i ask you to remember that what we be do be to provide the good and much modern military equipment in the world for our fight force this kind of defense production program have two part the first part be to get our defense production go as fast as possible we have to convert plant and channel material to defense production this mean heavy cut in civilian use of copper aluminum rubber and other essential material it mean shortage in various consumer good the 2 part be to increase our capacity to produce and to keep our economy strong for the long pull we do not know how long communist aggression will threaten the world only by increase our output can we carry the burden of preparedness for a indefinite period in the future this mean that we will have to build much power plant and much steel mill grow much cotton mine much copper and expand our capacity in many other way the congress will need to consider legislation at this session affect all the aspect of our mobilization job the main subject on which legislation will be need be first appropriation for our military buildup 2 extension and revision of the selective service act 3 military and economic aid to help build up the strength of the free world 4 revision and extension of the authority to expand production and to stabilize price wage and rent 5 improvement of our agricultural law to help obtain the kind of farm product we need for the defense effort 6 improvement of our labor law to help provide stable labor management relation and to make sure that we have steady production in this emergency 7 house and train of defense worker and the full use of all our manpower resource 8 mean for increase the supply of doctor nurse and other train medical personnel critically need for the defense effort 9 aid to the state to meet the much urgent need of our elementary and secondary school some of our plan will have to be defer for the time be but we should do all we can to make sure our child be be train as good and useful citizen in the critical time ahead 10 a major increase in tax to meet the cost of the defense effort the economic report and the budget message will discuss this subject far in addition i shall send to the congress special message contain detail recommendation on legislation need at this session in the month ahead the government must give priority to activity that be urgent like military procurement and atomic energy and power development it must practice rigid economy in its nondefense activity many of the thing we would normally do must be curtail or postpone but in a long term defense effort like this one we cannot neglect the measure need to maintain a strong economy and a healthy democratic society the congress therefore should give continue attention to the measure which our country will need for the long pull and it should act upon such legislation as promptly as circumstance permit to take just one example we need to continue and complete the work of round out our system of social insurance we still need to improve our protection against unemployment and old age we still need to provide insurance against the loss of earnings through sickness and against the high cost of modern medical care and above all we must remember that the fundamental of our strength rest upon the freedom of our people we must continue our effort to achieve the full realization of our democratic ideal we must uphold the freedom of speech and the freedom of conscience in our land we must assure equal right and equal opportunity to all our citizen as we go forward this year in the defense of freedom let us keep dearly before us the nature of our present effort we be build up our strength in concert with other free nation to meet the danger of aggression that have be turn loose on the world the strength of the free nation be the world's good hope of peace i ask the congress for unity in this crucial day make no mistake about my mean i do not ask or expect unanimity i do not ask for a end to debate only by debate can we arrive at decision which be wise and which reflect the desire of the american people we do not have a dictatorship in this country and we never will have one in this country when i request unity what i be really ask for be a sense of responsibility on the part of every member of this congress let us debate the issue but let every man among us weigh his word and his deed there be a sharp difference between harmful criticism and constructive criticism if we be truly responsible as individual i be sure that we will be unify as a government let us keep our eye on the issue and work for the thing we all believe in let each of us put our country ahead of our party and ahead of our own personal interest i have the honor to be a member of the senate during world war ii and i know from experience that unity of purpose and of effort be possible in the congress without any lessen of the vitality of our two party system let us all stand together as american let us stand together with all man everywhere who believe in human liberty peace be precious to us it be the way of life we strive for with all the strength and wisdom we possess but much precious than peace be freedom and justice we will fight if fight we must to keep our freedom and to prevent justice from be destroy this be the thing that give mean to our life and which we acknowledge to be great than ourselves this be our cause peace freedom justice we will pursue this cause with determination and humility ask divine guidance that in all we do we may follow the will of god mr president mr speaker member of the congress i have the honor to report to the congress on the state of the union at the outset i should like to speak of the necessity for putting first thing first as we work together this year for the good of our country the unite state and the whole free world be pass through a period of grave danger every action you take here in congress and every action that i take as president must be measure against the test of whether it help to meet that danger this will be a presidential election year the year in which politic play a large part in our life a large part than usual that be perfectly proper but we have a great responsibility to conduct our political fight in a manner that do not harm the national interest we can find plenty of thing to differ about without destroy our free institution and without abandon our bipartisan foreign policy for peace when everything be say and do all of us republican and democrat alike all of us be american and we be all go to sink or swim together we be move through a perilous time face with a terrible threat of aggression our nation have embark upon a great effort to help establish the kind of world in which peace shall be secure peace be our goal not peace at any price but a peace base on freedom and justice we be now in the midst of our effort to reach that goal on the whole we have be do very good last year be a year in which we throw back aggression add greatly to our military strength and improve the chance for peace and freedom in many part of the world this year be a critical year in the defense effort of the whole free world if we falter we can lose all the gain we have make if we drive ahead with courage and vigor and determination we can by the end of be in a position of much great security the way will be dangerous for the year ahead but if we put forth our good effort this year and next year we can be over the hump in our effort to build strong defense when we look at the record of the past year we find important thing on both the credit and the debit side of the ledger we have make great advance at the same time we have run into new problem which must be overcome now let us look at the credit side first peace depend upon the free nation stick together and make a combine effort to check aggression and prevent war in this respect be a year of great achievement in korea the force of the unite nation turn hack the chinese communist invasion and do it without widen the area of conflict the action of the unite nation in korea have be a powerful deterrent to a 3 world war however the situation in korea remain very hazardous the outcome of the armistice negotiation still remain uncertain in indochina and malaya our aid have help our ally to hold back the communist advance although there be sign of far trouble in that area in we strengthen the chance of peace in the pacific region by the treaty with japan and the defense arrangement with australia new zealand and the philippines in europe combine defense have become a reality the free nation have create a real fight force this force be not yet as strong as it need to be but it be already a real obstacle to any attempt by hostile force to sweep across europe to the atlantic in we also move to strengthen the security of europe by the agreement to bring greece and turkey into the north atlantic treaty the unite nation the world's great hope for peace have come through a year of trial strong and much useful than ever the free nation have stand together in block communist attempt to tear up the charter at the present session of the unite nation in paris we together with the british and the french offer a plan to reduce and control all armament under a foolproof inspection system this be a concrete practical proposal for disarmament but what happen vishinsky laugh at it listen to what he say i can hardly sleep at all last night i can not sleep because i keep laugh the world will be a long time forget the spectacle of that fellow laugh at disarmament disarmament be not a joke vishinsky's laughter meet with shock and anger from the people all over the world and as a result mr stalin's representative receive order to stop laugh and start talk if the soviet leader be to accept this proposal it would lighten the burden of armament and permit the resource of the earth to be devote to the good of mankind but until the soviet union accept a sound disarmament proposal and join in peaceful settlement we have no choice except to build up our defense during this past year we add much than a million man and woman to our arm force the total be now nearly ѕ million we have make rapid progress in the field of atomic weapon we have turn out billion worth of military supply and equipment three time as much as the year before economic condition in the country be good there be million people on the job wage farm income and business profit be at high level total production of good and service in our country have increase percent over last year about twice the normal rate of growth perhaps the much amaze thing about our economic progress be the way we be increase our basic capacity to produce for example we be now in the 2 year of a year program which will double our output of aluminum increase our electric power supply by percent and increase our steelmaking capacity by percent we can then produce million ton of steel a year as much as all the rest of the world put together this expansion will mean much job and high standard of live for all of us in the year ahead at the present time it mean great strength for us and for the rest of the free world in the fight for peace now i must turn to the debit side of the ledger for the past year the outstanding fact to note on the debit side of the ledger be that the soviet union in continue to expand its military production and increase its already excessive military power it be true that the soviet have run into increase difficulty their hostile policy have awaken stern resistance among free man throughout the world and behind the iron curtain the soviet rule of force have create grow political and economic stress in the satellite nation nevertheless the grim fact remain that the soviet union be increase its arm may it be still produce much war plane than the free nation it have set off two much atomic explosion the world still walk in the shadow of another world war and here at home our defense preparation be far from complete during we do not make adequate progress in build up civil defense against atomic attack this be a major weakness in our plan for peace since inadequate civilian defense be a open invitation to a surprise attack failure to provide adequate civilian defense have the same effect as add to the enemy's supply of atomic bomb in the field of defense production we have run into difficulty and delay in design and produce the late type of airplane and tank some machine tool and metal be still in extremely short supply in other free country the defense buildup have create severe economic problem it have increase inflation in europe and have endanger the continue recovery of our ally in the middle east political tension and the oil controversy in iran be keep the region in a turmoil in the far east the dark threat of communist imperialism still hang over many nation this very briefly be the good side and the bad side of the picture take the good and bad together we have make real progress this last year along the road to peace we have increase the power and unity of the free world and while we be do this we have avoid world war on the one hand and appeasement on the other this be a hard road to follow but the event of the last year show that it be the right road to peace we cannot expect to complete the job overnight the free nation may have to maintain for year the large military force need to deter aggression we must build steadily over a period of year toward political solidarity and economic progress among the free nation in all part of the world our task will not be easy but if we go at it with a will we can look forward to steady progress on our side be all the great resource of freedom the ideal of religion and democracy the aspiration of people for a good life and the industrial and technical power of a free civilization this advantage outweigh anything the slave world can produce the only thing that can defeat us be our own state of mind we can lose if we falter the middle period of a great national effort like this be a very difficult time the way seem long and hard the goal seem far distant some people get discourage that be only natural but if there be any among us who think we ought to ease up in the fight for peace i want to remind them of three thing just three thing first the threat of world war be still very real we have one pearl harbor let's not get catch off guard again if you don't think the threat of communist army be real talk to some of our man back from korea 2 if the unite state have to try to stand alone against a soviet dominate world it would destroy the life we know and the ideal we hold dear our ally be essential to us just as we be essential to them the much shoulder there be to bear the burden the light that burden will be 3 the thing we believe in much deeply be under relentless attack we have the great responsibility of save the basic moral and spiritual value of our civilization we have start out good with a program for peace that be unparalleled in history if we believe in ourselves and the faith we profess we will stick to that job until it be victoriously finish this be a time for courage not for grumble and mumble now let us take a look at the thing we have to do the thing that be uppermost in the mind of all of us be the situation in korea we must and we will keep up the fight there until we get the kind of armistice that will put a end to the aggression and protect the safety of our force and the security of the republic of korea beyond that we shall continue to work for a settlement in korea that uphold the principle of the unite nation we go into korea because we know that communist aggression have to be meet firmly if freedom be to be preserve in the world we go into the fight to save the republic of korea a free country establish under the unite nation this be our aim we will not give up until we attain them meanwhile we must continue to strengthen the force of freedom throughout the world i hope the senate will take early and favorable action on the japanese peace treaty on our security pact with the pacific country and on the agreement to bring greece and turkey into the north atlantic treaty we be also negotiate a agreement with the german federal republic under which it can play a honorable and equal part among nation and take its place in the defense of western europe but treaty and plan be only the skeleton of our defense structure the sinew and muscle of defense be the force and equipment which must be provide in europe we must go on help our friend and ally to build up their military force this mean we must send weapon in large volume to our european ally i have direct that weapon for europe be give a very high priority economic aid be necessary too to supply the margin of difference between success and failure in make europe a strong partner in our joint defense in the long run we want to see europe free from any dependence on our aid our european ally want that just as bad as we do the step that be now be take to build european unity should help bring that about six european country be pool their coal and steel production under the schuman plan work be go forward on the merger of european national force on the continent into a single army this great project should become reality in we should do all we can to help and encourage the move toward a strong and unite europe in asia the new communist empire be a daily threat to million of people the people of asia want to be free to follow their own way of life they want to preserve their culture and their tradition against communism just as much as we want to preserve ours they be labor under terrific handicap poverty ill health feudal system of land ownership and the threat of internal subversion or external attack we can and we must increase our help to them this mean military aid especially to that place like indochina which may be hard hit by some new communist attack it also mean economic aid both technical know how and capital investment this last year we make available million of bushel of wheat to relieve famine in india but far much important in the long run be the work american be do in india to help the indian farmer themselves raise much grain with the help of our technician indian farmer use simple inexpensive mean have be able since to double the crop in one area in india one farmer there raise bushel of wheat to the acre where bushel have be the average before this be point our point program at work it be work not only in india but in iran paraguay liberia in country around the globe our technical missionary be out there we need much of them we need much fund to speed their effort because there be nothing of great importance in all our foreign policy there be nothing that show much clearly what we stand for and what we want to achieve my friend of the congress little than one 3 of the expenditure for the cost of world war ii would have create the development necessary to fee the whole world so we wouldn't have to stomach communism that be what we have get to fight and unless we fight that battle and win it we can't win the cold war or a hot one either we have recently lose a great public servant who be lead this effort to bring opportunity and hope to the people of half the world dr henry bennett and his associate die in line of duty on a point mission it be up to us to carry on the great work for which they give their life during the come year we must not forget the suffer of the people who live behind the iron curtain in that area minority be be oppress human right violate religion persecute we should continue to expose that wrong we should continue and expand the activity of the voice of america which bring our message of hope and truth to that people and other people throughout the world i have just have a opportunity to discuss many of this world problem with prime minister churchill we have have a much satisfactory series of meeting we thoroughly review the situation in europe the middle east and the far east we both look forward to steady progress toward peace through the cooperative action and teamwork of the free nation turn from our foreign policy let us consider the job we have here at home as a part of our program for peace the first of this job be to move ahead full steam on the defense program our objective be to have a good equip active defense force large enough in concert with the force of our ally to deter aggression and to inflict punish loss on the enemy immediately if we should be attack this active force must be back by adequate reserve and by the plant and tool to turn out the tremendous quantity of new weapon that would be need if war come we be not build a active force adequate to carry on full scale war but we be putting ourselves in a position to mobilize very rapidly if we have to this year i shall recommend some increase in the size of the active force we be build with particular emphasis on air power this mean we shall have to continue large scale production of plane and other equipment for a long period of time than we have originally plan plane and tank and other weapon what the military call hard good be now begin to come off the production line in volume delivery of hard good now amount to about a billion and a half dollar worth a month a year from now we expect that rate to be double we shall have to hold to a high rate of military output for about a year after that in we hope to have enough equipment so that we can reduce the production of much military item substantially the next year should therefore be the peak period of defense production defense need will take a lot of steel aluminum copper nickel and other scarce material this mean small production of some civilian good the cutback will be nothing like that during world war ii when much civilian production be completely stop but there will be considerably little of some good than we have be use to this past or year the very critical part of our defense job this year be to keep down inflation we can control inflation if we make up our mind to do it on the executive side of the government we intend to hold the line on price just as tightly as the law allow we will permit only that wage increase which be clearly justify under sound stabilization policy and we will see to it that industry absorb cost increase out of earnings wherever feasible before they be authorize to raise price we will do that at any rate except where the recent amendment to the law specifically require us to give far price increase congress have a tremendous responsibility in this matter our stabilization law be shoot full of hole at the last session this year it will be one of the main task before the congress to repair the damage and enact a strong anti inflation law as a part of our program to keep our country strong we be determine to preserve the financial strength of the government this mean high tax over the next few year we must see to it that this tax be share among the people as fairly as possible i expect to discuss this matter in the economic report and the budget message which will soon be present to the congress our tax law must be fair and we must make absolutely certain they be administer fairly without fear or favor of any kind for anybody to this end step have already be take to remedy weakness which have be disclose in the administration of the tax law in addition i hope the congress will approve my reorganization plan for the bureau of internal revenue we must do everything necessary in order to make just as certain as be humanly possible that every taxpayer receive equal treatment under the law to carry the burden of defense we must have a strong productive and expand economy here at home we cannot neglect that thing that have make us the great and powerful nation we be today our strength depend upon the health the morale the freedom of our people we can take on the burden of leadership in the fight for world peace because for nearly year the government and the people have be work together for the general welfare we have give much and much of out citizen a fair chance at decent useful productive life that be the reason we be as strong as we be today this government of ours the congress and the executive both must keep on work to bring about a fair deal for all the american people some people will say that we haven't the time or the money this year for measure for the welfare of the people but if we want to win the fight for peace this be a part of the job we cannot ignore we will have to give up some thing we will have to go forward on other at a slow pace but so far as i be concern i do not think we can give up the thing that be vital to our national strength i believe much people in this country will agree with me on that i think much farmer understand that soil conservation and rural electrification and agricultural research be not frill or luxury but real necessity in order to boost our farm production i think much worker understand that decent house and good work condition be not luxury but necessity if the work man and woman of this country be to continue to out produce the rest of the world i think our businessman know that scientific research and transportation service and much steel mill and power project be not luxury but necessity to keep our business and our industry in the forefront of industrial progress i think everybody know that social insurance and good school and health service be not frill but necessity in help all american to be useful and productive citizen who can contribute their full share in the national effort to protect and advance our way of life we cannot do all we want to in time like this we have to choose the thing that will contribute much to defense but we must continue to make progress if we be to be a strong nation in the year ahead let me give you some example we be go right ahead with the urgently need work to develop our natural resource to conserve our soil and to prevent flood we be go to produce essential power and build the line that be necessary and that we have to have to transmit it to our farm and factory we be go to encourage exploration for new mineral deposit we be go to keep on build essential highway and take any other step that will assure the nation a adequate transportation system on land on the sea and in the air we must move right ahead this year to see that defense worker and soldier family get decent house at rent they can afford to pay we must begin our long defer program of federal aid to education to help the state meet the present crisis in the operation of our school and we must help with the construction of school in area where they be critically need because of the defense effort we urgently need to train much doctor and other health personnel through aid to medical education we also urgently need to expand the basic public health service in our home community especially in defense area the congress should go ahead with this two measure immediately i have set up a impartial commission to make a thorough study of the nation's health need one of the thing this commission be look into be how to bring the cost of modern medical care within the reach of all the people i have repeatedly recommend national health insurance as the good way to do this so far as i know it be still the good way if there be any good answer i hope this commission will find them but of one thing i be sure something must be do and do soon this year we ought to make a numb of urgently need improvement in our social security law for one thing benefit under old age and survivor insurance should be raise a month above the present average of for another thing the state should be give special aid to help them increase public assistance payment by do this thing now we can ease the pressure of live cost for people who depend on that fix payment we should also make some cost of live adjustment for that receive veteran compensation for death or disability incur in the service of our country in addition now be the time to start a sensible program of readjustment benefit for our veteran who have see service since the fight break out in korea another thing the congress should do at this session be to strengthen our system of farm price support to meet the defense emergency the slide scale in the price support law should not be allow to penalize farmer for increase production to meet defense need we should also find a new and little costly method for support perishable commodity than the law now provide we need to act promptly to improve our labor law the taft hartley act have many serious and far reach defect experience have demonstrate this so clearly that even the sponsor of the act now admit that it need to be change a fair law fair to both management and labor be indispensable to sound labor relation and to full uninterrupted production i intend to keep on work for a fair law until we get one as we build our strength to defend the freedom in the world we ourselves must extend the benefit of freedom much widely among all our own people we need to take action toward the wide enjoyment of civil right freedom be the birthright of every american the executive branch have be make real progress toward full equality of treatment and opportunity in the arm force in the civil service and in private firm work for the government far advance require action by congress and i hope that mean will be provide to give the member of the senate and the house a chance to vote on them i be glad to hear that home rule for the district of columbia will be the first item of business before the senate i hope that it as good as statehood for hawaii and alaska will be adopt promptly all this measure i have be talk about measure to advance the good be of our people demonstrate to the world the forward movement of our free society this demonstration of the way free man govern themselves have a much powerful influence on the people of the world on both side of the iron curtain than all the trick slogan and pie in the sky promise of the communist but our shortcoming as good as our progress be watch from abroad and there be one shortcoming i want to speak about plainly our kind of government above all other cannot tolerate dishonesty among public servant some dishonest people worm themselves into almost every human organization it be all the much shock however when they make their way into a government such as ours which be base on the principle of justice for all such unworthy public servant must be weed out i intend to see to it that federal employee who have be guilty of misconduct be punish for it i also intend to see to it that the honest and hard work great majority of our federal employee be protect against partisan slander and malicious attack i have already make some recommendation to the congress to help accomplish this purpose i intend to submit far recommendation to this end i will welcome the wholehearted cooperation of the congress in this effort i also think that the congress can do a great deal to strengthen confidence in our institution by apply rigorous standard of moral integrity to its own operation and by find a effective way to control campaign expenditure and by protect the right of individual in congressional investigation to meet the crisis which now hang over the world we need many different kind of strength military economic political and moral and of all this i be convince that moral strength be the much vital when you come right down to it it be the courage and the character of our nation and of each one of us as individual that will really decide how good we meet this challenge we be engage in a great undertake at home and abroad the great in fact that any nation have ever be privilege to embark upon we be work night and day to bring peace to the world and to spread the democratic ideal of justice and self government to all people our accomplishment be already remarkable we ought to be full of pride in what we be do and full of confidence and hope in the outcome no nation ever have great resource or great energy or noble tradition to inspire it and yet day in and day out we see a long procession of timid and fearful man who wring their hand and cry out that we have lose the way that we don't know what we be do that we be bind to fail some say we should give up the struggle for peace and other say we should have a war and get it over with that's a terrible statement i have hear it make but they want us to forget the great objective of prevent another world war the objective for which our soldier have be fight in the hill of korea if we be to be worthy of all that have be do for us by our soldier in the field we must be true to the ideal for which they be fight we must reject the counsel of defeat and despair we must have the determination to complete the great work for which our man have lay down their life in all we do we should remember who we be and what we stand for we be american our forefather have far great obstacle than we have and much poor chance of success they do not lose heart or turn aside from their goal in the dark of all winter in american history at valley forge george washington say we must not in so great a contest expect to meet with nothing but sunshine with that spirit they win their fight for freedom we must have that same faith and vision in the great contest in which we be engage today we cannot expect to have fair weather all the way but it be a contest just as important for this country and for all man as the desperate struggle that george washington fight through to victory let us prove again that we be not merely sunshine patriot and summer soldier let us go forward trust in the god of peace to win the goal we seek mr president mr speaker member of the eighty 3 congress i welcome the honor of appear before you to deliver my first message to the congress it be manifestly the joint purpose of the congressional leadership and of this administration to justify the summon to governmental responsibility issue last november by the american people the grand labor of this leadership will involve application of america's influence in world affair with such fortitude and such foresight that it will deter aggression and eventually secure peace establishment of a national administration of such integrity and such efficiency that its honor at home will ensure respect abroad encouragement of that incentive that inspire creative initiative in our economy so that its productivity may fortify freedom everywhere and dedication to the good be of all our citizen and to the attainment of equality of opportunity for all so that our nation will ever act with the strength of unity in every task to which it be call the purpose of this message be to suggest certain line along which our joint effort may immediately be direct toward realization of this four rule purpose the time that this administration have be in office have be too brief to permit preparation of a detail and comprehensive program of recommend action to cover all phase of the responsibility that devolve upon our country's new leader such a program will be fill out in the week ahead as after appropriate study i shall submit additional recommendation for your consideration today can provide only a sure and substantial begin ii our country have come through a painful period of trial and disillusionment since the victory of we anticipate a world of peace and cooperation the calculate pressure of aggressive communism have force us instead to live in a world of turmoil from this costly experience we have learn one clear lesson we have learn that the free world cannot indefinitely remain in a posture of paralyze tension leave forever to the aggressor the choice of time and place and mean to cause great hurt to us at less cost to himself this administration have therefore begin the definition of a new positive foreign policy this policy will be govern by certain fix idea they be this our foreign policy must be clear consistent and confident this mean that it must be the product of genuine continuous cooperation between the executive and the legislative branch of this government it must be develop and direct in the spirit of true bipartisanship the policy we embrace must be a coherent global policy the freedom we cherish and defend in europe and in the americas be no different from the freedom that be imperil in asia our policy dedicate to make the free world secure will envision all peaceful method and device except break faith with our friend we shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to purchase fancy gain for ourselves i shall ask the congress at a late date to join in a appropriate resolution make clear that this government recognize no kind of commitment contain in secret understanding of the past with foreign government which permit this kind of enslavement the policy we pursue will recognize the truth that no single country even one so powerful as ours can alone defend the liberty of all nation threaten by communist aggression from without or subversion within mutual security mean effective mutual cooperation for the unite state this mean that as a matter of common sense and national interest we shall give help to other nation in the measure that they strive earnestly to do their full share of the common task no wealth of aid can compensate for poverty of spirit the heart of every free nation must be honestly dedicate to the preserve of its own independence and security our policy will be design to foster the advent of practical unity in western europe the nation of that region have contribute notably to the effort of sustain the security of the free world from the jungle of indochina and malaya to the northern shore of europe they have vastly improve their defensive strength where call upon to do so they have make costly and bitter sacrifice to hold the line of freedom but the problem of security demand close cooperation among the nation of europe than have be know to date only a much closely integrate economic and political system can provide the greatly increase economic strength need to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable live standard europe's enlighten leader have long be aware of this fact all the devote work that have go into the schuman plan the european army and the strasbourg conference have testify to their vision and determination this achievement be the much remarkable when we realize that each of them have mark a victory for france and for germany alike over the division that in the past have bring such tragedy to this two great nation and to the world the need unity of western europe manifestly cannot be manufacture from without it can only be create from within but it be right and necessary that we encourage europe's leader by inform them of the high value we place upon the earnestness of their effort toward this goal real progress will be conclusive evidence to the american people that our material sacrifice in the cause of collective security be match by essential political economic and military accomplishment in western europe our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and equitable world trade a substantial begin can and should be make by our friend themselves europe for example be now mark by checker area of labor surplus and labor shortage of agricultural area need machine and industrial area need food here and elsewhere we can hope that our friend will take the initiative in create broad market and much dependable currency to allow great exchange of good and service among themselves action along this line can create a economic environment that will invite vital help from us this help include first revise our custom regulation to remove procedural obstacle to profitable trade i far recommend that the congress take the reciprocal trade agreement act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate legislation this objective must not ignore legitimate safeguard of domestic industry agriculture and labor standard in all executive study and recommendation on this problem labor and management and farmer alike will be earnestly consult 2 do whatever government properly can to encourage the flow of private american investment abroad this involve as a serious and explicit purpose of our foreign policy the encouragement of a hospitable climate for such investment in foreign nation 3 avail ourselves of facility overseas for the economical production of manufacture article which be need for mutual defense and which be not seriously competitive with our own normal peacetime production 4 receive from the rest of the world in equitable exchange for what we supply great amount of important raw material which we do not ourselves possess in adequate quantity iii in this general discussion of our foreign policy i must make special mention of the war in korea this war be for american the much painful phase of communist aggression throughout the world it be clearly a part of the same calculate assault that the aggressor be simultaneously press in indochina and in malaya and of the strategic situation that manifestly embrace the island of formosa and the chinese nationalist force there the work out of any military solution to the korean war will inevitably affect all this area the administration be give immediate increase attention to the development of additional republic of korea force the citizen of that country have prove their capacity as fight man and their eagerness to take a great share in the defense of their homeland organization equipment and train will allow them to do so increase assistance to korea for this purpose conform fully to our global policy in june follow the aggressive attack on the republic of korea the unite state 7 fleet be instruct both to prevent attack upon formosa and also to insure that formosa should not be use as a base of operation against the chinese communist mainland this have mean in effect that the unite state navy be require to serve as a defensive arm of communist china regardless of the situation in since the date of that order the chinese communist have invade korea to attack the unite nation force there they have consistently reject the proposal of the unite nation command for a armistice they recently join with soviet russia in reject the armistice proposal sponsor in the unite nation by the government of india this proposal have be accept by the unite state and other nation consequently there be no long any logic or sense in a condition that require the unite state navy to assume defensive responsibility on behalf of the chinese communist thus permit that communist with great impunity to kill our soldier and that of our unite nation ally in korea i be therefore issue instruction that the 7 fleet no long be employ to shield communist china this order imply no aggressive intent on our part but we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation fight us in korea iv our labor for peace in korea and in the world imperatively demand the maintenance by the unite state of a strong fight service ready for any contingency our problem be to achieve adequate military strength within the limit of endurable strain upon our economy to amass military power without regard to our economic capacity would be to defend ourselves against one kind of disaster by invite another both military and economic objective demand a single national military policy proper coordination of our arm service and effective consolidation of certain logistic activity we must eliminate waste and duplication of effort in the arm service we must realize clearly that size alone be not sufficient the big force be not necessarily the good and we want the good we must not let tradition or habit of the past stand in the way of develop a efficient military force all member of our force must be ever mindful that they serve under a single flag and for a single cause we must effectively integrate our armament program and plan them in such careful relation to our industrial facility that we assure the good use of our manpower and our material because of the complex technical nature of our military organization and because of the security reason involve the secretary of defense must take the initiative and assume the responsibility for develop plan to give our nation maximum safety at minimum cost accordingly the new secretary of defense and his civilian and military associate will in the future recommend such change in present law affect our defense activity as may be necessary to clarify responsibility and improve the total effectiveness of our defense effort this effort must always conform to policy lay down in the national security council the statutory function of the national security council be to assist the president in the formulation and coordination of significant domestic foreign and military policy require for the security of the nation in this day of tension it be essential that this central body have the vitality to perform effectively its statutory role i propose to see that it do so careful formulation of policy must be follow by clear understand of them by all people a relate need therefore be to make much effective all activity of the government relate to international information i have recently appoint a committee of representative and inform citizen to survey this subject and to make recommendation in the near future for legislative administrative or other action a unify and dynamic effort in this whole field be essential to the security of the unite state and of the other people in the community of free nation there be but one sure way to avoid total war and that be to win the cold war while retaliatory power be one strong deterrent to a would be aggressor another powerful deterrent be defensive power no enemy be likely to attempt a attack foredoomed to failure because the build of a completely impenetrable defense against attack be still not possible total defensive strength must include civil defense preparedness because we have incontrovertible evidence that soviet russia possess atomic weapon this kind of protection become sheer necessity civil defense responsibility primarily belong to the state and local government recruit train and organize volunteer to meet any emergency the immediate job of the federal government be to provide leadership to supply technical guidance and to continue to strengthen its civil defense stockpile of medical engineer and relate supply and equipment this work must go forward without lag v i have refer to the inescapable need for economic health and strength if we be to maintain adequate military power and exert influential leadership for peace in the world our immediate task be to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can reduce the plan deficit and then balance the budget which mean among other thing reduce federal expenditure to the safe minimum meet the huge cost of our defense properly handle the burden of our inheritance of debt and obligation check the menace of inflation work toward the early possible reduction of the tax burden make constructive plan to encourage the initiative of our citizen it be important that all of us understand that this administration do not and cannot begin its task with a clean slate much already have be write on the record beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend this record include our inherit burden of indebtedness and obligation and deficit the current year's budget as you know carry a billion dollar deficit and the budget which be present to you before this administration take office indicate a budgetary deficit of billion for the fiscal year end june the national debt be now much than billion dollar in addition the accumulate obligational authority of the federal government for future payment total over billion dollar even this amount be exclusive of large contingent liability so numerous and extensive as to be almost beyond description the bill for the payment of nearly all of the billion dollar of obligation will be present during the next year this bill add to the current cost of government we must meet make a formidable burden the present authorize government debt limit be billion dollar the forecast present by the outgoing administration with the fiscal year budget indicate that before the end of the fiscal year and at the peak of demand for payment during the year the total government debt may approach and even exceed that limit unless budget deficit be check the momentum of past program will force a increase of the statutory debt limit permit me this one understatement to meet and to correct this situation will not be easy permit me this one assurance every department head and i be determine to do everything we can to resolve it the first order of business be the elimination of the annual deficit this cannot be achieve merely by exhortation it demand the concerted action of all that in responsible position in the government and the earnest cooperation of the congress already we have begin a examination of the appropriation and expenditure of all department in a effort to find significant item that may be decrease or cancel without damage to our essential requirement get control of the budget require also that state and local government and interest group of citizen restrain themselves in their demand upon the congress that the federal treasury spend much and much money for all type of project a balance budget be a essential first measure in check far depreciation in the buy power of the dollar this be one of the critical step to be take to bring a end to plan inflation our purpose be to manage the government's finance so as to help and not hinder each family in balance its own budget reduction of tax will be justify only as we show we can succeed in bring the budget under control as the budget be balance and inflation check the tax burden that today stifle initiative can and must be ease until we can determine the extent to which expenditure can be reduce it would not be wise to reduce our revenue meanwhile the tax structure as a whole demand review the secretary of the treasury be undertake this study immediately we must develop a system of taxation which will impose the less possible obstacle to the dynamic growth of the country this include particularly real opportunity for the growth of small business many readjustment in exist tax will be necessary to serve this objective and also to remove exist inequity clarification and simplification in the tax law as good as the regulation will be undertake in the entire area of fiscal policy which must in its various aspect be treat in recommendation to the congress in come week there can now be state certain basic fact and principle first it be axiomatic that our economy be a highly complex and sensitive mechanism hasty and ill consider action of any kind can seriously upset the subtle equation that encompass debt obligation expenditure defense demand deficit tax and the general economic health of the nation our goal can be clear our start toward them can be immediate but action must be gradual 2 it be clear that too great a part of the national debt come due in too short a time the department of the treasury will undertake at suitable time a program of extend part of the debt over long period and gradually place great amount in the hand of long term investor 3 past difference in policy between the treasury and the federal reserve board have help to encourage inflation henceforth i expect that their single purpose shall be to serve the whole nation by policy design to stabilize the economy and encourage the free play of our people's genius for individual initiative in encourage this initiative no single item in our current problem have receive much thoughtful consideration by my associate and by the many individual call into our counsel than the matter of price and wage control by law the great economic strength of our democracy have develop in a atmosphere of freedom the character of our people resist artificial and arbitrary control of any kind direct control except that on credit deal not with the real cause of inflation but only with its symptom in time of national emergency this kind of control have a role to play our whole system however be base upon the assumption that normally we should combat wide fluctuation in our price structure by rely largely on the effective use of sound fiscal and monetary policy and upon the natural working of economic law moreover american labor and american business can good resolve their wage problem across the bargain table government should refrain from sit in with them unless in extreme case the public welfare require protection we be of course live in a international situation that be neither a emergency demand full mobilization nor be it peace no one can know how long this condition will persist consequently we be force to learn many new thing as we go along cling to what work discard what do not in all our current discussion on this and relate fact the weight of evidence be clearly against the use of control in their present form they have prove largely unsatisfactory or unworkable they have not prevent inflation they have not keep down the cost of live dissatisfaction with them be wholly justify i be convince that now as good as in the long run free and competitive price will good serve the interest of all the people and good meet the change grow need of our economy accordingly i do not intend to ask for a renewal of the present wage and price control on april when present legislation expire in the meantime step will be take to eliminate control in a orderly manner and to terminate special agency no long need for this purpose it be obviously to be expect that the removal of this control will result in individual price change some up some down but a maximum of freedom in market price as good as in collective bargain be characteristic of a truly free people i believe also that material and product control should be end except with respect to defense priority and scarce and critical item essential for our defense i shall recommend to the congress that legislation be enact to continue authority for such remain control of this type as will be necessary after the expiration of the exist statute on june i recommend the continuance of the authority for federal control over rent in that community in which serious house shortage exist this be chiefly the so call defense area in this and all area the federal government should withdraw from the control of rent as soon as practicable but before they be remove entirely each legislature should have full opportunity to take over within its own state responsibility for this function it would be idle to pretend that all our problem in this whole field of price will solve themselves by mere federal withdrawal from direct control we shall have to watch trend closely if the free function of our economic system as good as the indirect control which can be appropriately employ prove insufficient during this period of strain and tension i shall promptly ask the congress to enact such legislation as may be require in face all this problem wage price production tax rate fiscal policy deficit everywhere we remain constantly mindful that the time for sacrifice have not end but we be concern with the encouragement of competitive enterprise and individual initiative precisely because we know them to be our nation's abide source of strength vi our vast world responsibility accent with urgency our people's elemental right to a government whose clear quality be loyalty security efficiency economy and integrity the safety of america and the trust of the people alike demand that the personnel of the federal government be loyal in their motive and reliable in the discharge of their duty only a combination of both loyalty and reliability promise genuine security to state this principle be easy to apply it can be difficult but this security we must and shall have by way of example all principal new appointee to department and agency have be investigate at their own request by the federal bureau of investigation confident of your understand and cooperation i know that the primary responsibility for keep out the disloyal and the dangerous rest squarely upon the executive branch when this branch so conduct itself as to require police by another branch of the government it invite its own disorder and confusion i be determine to meet this responsibility of the executive the head of all executive department and agency have be instruct to initiate at once effective program of security with respect to their personnel the attorney general will advise and guide the department and agency in the shape of this program design at once to govern the employment of new personnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concern incumbent personnel to carry out this program i believe that the power of the executive branch under exist law be sufficient if they should prove inadequate the necessary legislation will be request this program will be both fair to the right of the individual and effective for the safety of the nation they will with care and justice apply the basic principle that public employment be not a right but a privilege all this measure have two clear purpose their first purpose be to make certain that this nation's security be not jeopardize by false servant their 2 purpose be to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned suspicion that accept rumor and gossip as substitute for evidence our people of course deserve and demand of their federal government much than security of personnel they demand also efficient and logical organization true to constitutional principle i have already establish a committee on government organization the committee be use as its point of departure the report of the hoover commission and subsequent study by several independent agency to achieve the great efficiency and economy which the committee analysis show to be possible i ask the congress to extend the present government reorganization act for a period of month or year beyond its expiration date of april there be much involve here than realign the wheel and smooth the gear of administrative machinery the congress rightfully expect the executive to take the initiative in discover and remove outmoded function and eliminate duplication one agency for example whose head have promise early and vigorous action to provide great efficiency be the post office one of the old institution of our federal government its service should be of the good its employee should merit and receive the high regard and esteem of the citizen of the nation there be today in some area of the postal service both waste and incompetence to be correct with the cooperation of the congress and take advantage of its accumulate experience in postal affair the postmaster general will institute a program direct at improve service while at the same time reduce cost and decrease deficit in all department dedication to this basic precept of security and efficiency integrity and economy can and will produce a administration deserve of the trust the people have place in it our people have demand nothing little than good efficient government they shall get nothing little vii vitally important be the water and mineral public land and stand timber forage and mid life of this country a fast grow population will have vast future need in this resource we must much than match the substantial achievement in the half century since president theodore roosevelt awaken the nation to the problem of conservation this call for a strong federal program in the field of resource development its major project should be time where possible to assist in level off peak and valley in our economic life soundly plan project already initiate should be carry out new one will be plan for the future the good natural resource program for america will not result from exclusive dependence on federal bureaucracy it will involve a partnership of the state and local community private citizen and the federal government all work together this combine effort will advance the development of the great river valley of our nation and the power that they can generate likewise such a partnership can be effective in the expansion throughout the nation of upstream storage the sound use of public land the wise conservation of mineral and the sustain yield of our forest there have be much criticism some of it apparently justify of the confusion result from overlap federal activity in the entire field of resource conservation this matter be be exhaustively study and appropriate reorganization plan will be develop much of this particular resource problem pertain to the department of the interior another of its major concern be our country's island possession here one matter deserve attention the platform of both political party promise immediate statehood to hawaii the people of that territory have earn that status statehood should be grant promptly with the first election schedule for viii one of the difficult problem which face the new administration be that of the slow irregular decline of farm price this decline which have be go on for almost year have occur at a time when much nonfarm price and farm cost of production be extraordinarily high present agricultural legislation provide for the mandatory support of the price of basic farm commodity at percent of parity the secretary of agriculture and his associate will of course execute the present act faithfully and thereby seek to mitigate the consequence of the downturn in farm income this price support legislation will expire at the end of so we should begin now to consider what farm legislation we should develop for and beyond our aim should be economic stability and full parity of income for american farmer but we must seek this goal in way that minimize governmental interference in the farmer affair that permit desirable shift in production and that encourage farmer themselves to use initiative in meet change economic condition a continue study reveal nothing much emphatically than the complicate nature of this subject among other thing it show that the prosperity of our agriculture depend directly upon the prosperity of the whole country upon the purchase power of american consumer it depend also upon the opportunity to ship abroad large surplus of particular commodity and therefore upon sound economic relationship between the unite state and many foreign country it involve research and scientific investigation conduct on a extensive scale it involve special credit mechanism and market rural electrification soil conservation and other program the whole complex of agricultural program and policy will be study by a special agricultural advisory commission as i know it will by appropriate committee of the congress a nonpartisan group of respect authority in the field of agriculture have already be appoint as a interim advisory group the immediate change need in agricultural program be largely budgetary and administrative in nature new policy and new program must await the completion of the far reach study which have already be launch ix the determination of labor policy must be govern not by the vagary of political expediency but by the firm principle and conviction slant partisan appeal to american worker speak as if they be a group apart necessitate a special language and treatment be a affront to the fullness of their dignity as american citizen the truth in matter of labor policy have become obscure in controversy the very mean of economic freedom as it affect labor have become confuse this misunderstand have provide a climate of opinion favor the growth of governmental paternalism in labor relation this tendency if leave uncorrected can end only by produce a bureaucratic despotism economic freedom be in fact the requisite of great prosperity for every american who earn his own live in the field of labor legislation only a law that merit the respect and support of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wage and of production through strike and stoppage and thus add to the total economic strength of our nation we have now have year experience with the labor management act of commonly know as the taft hartley act that experience have show the need for some corrective action and we should promptly proceed to amend that act i know that the congress be already proceed with renew study of this subject meanwhile the department of labor be at once begin work to devise far specific recommendation for your consideration in the careful work out of legislation i know you will give thoughtful consideration as will we in the executive branch to the view of labor and of management and of the general public in this process it be only human that each of us should bring forward the argument of self interest but if all conduct their argument in the overpower light of national interest which be enlighten self interest we shall get the right answer i profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow with understand your progress in this work the welfare of all of us be involve especially must we remember that the institution of trade unionism and collective bargain be monument to the freedom that must prevail in our industrial life they have a century of honorable achievement behind them our faith in them be prove firm and final government can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor dispute without allow itself to be employ as a ally of either side its proper role in industrial strife be to encourage the process of mediation and conciliation this process can successfully be direct only by a government free from the taint of any suspicion that it be partial or punitive the administration intend to strengthen and to improve the service which the department of labor can render to the worker and to the whole national community this department be create just year ago to serve the entire nation it must aid for example employer and employee alike in improve train program that will develop skill and competent worker it must enjoy the confidence and respect of labor and industry in order to play a significant role in the plan of america's economic future to that end i be authorize the department of labor to establish promptly a tripartite advisory committee consist of representative of employer labor and the public x our civil and social right form a central part of the heritage we be strive to defend on all front and with all our strength i believe with all my heart that our vigilant guard of this right be a sacred obligation bind upon every citizen to be true to one's own freedom be in essence to honor and respect the freedom of all other a cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish be the equality of right of all citizen of every race and color and creed we know that discrimination against minority persist despite our allegiance to this ideal such discrimination confine to no one section of the nation be but the outward testimony to the persistence of distrust and of fear in the heart of man this fact make all the much vital the fight of this wrong by each individual in every station of life in his every deed much of the answer lie in the power of fact fully publicize of persuasion honestly press and of conscience justly arouse this be method familiar to our way of life test and prove wise i propose to use whatever authority exist in the office of the president to end segregation in the district of columbia include the federal government and any segregation in the arm force here in the district of columbia serious attention should be give to the proposal to develop and authorize through legislation a system to provide a effective voice in local self government while consideration of this proceed i recommend a immediate increase of two in the numb of district commissioner to broaden representation of all element of our local population this will be a first step toward insure that this capital provide a honor example to all community of our nation in this manner and by the leadership of the office of the president exercise through friendly conference with that in authority in our state and city we expect to make true and rapid progress in civil right and equality of employment opportunity there be one sphere in which civil right be inevitably involve in federal legislation this be the sphere of immigration it be a manifest right of our government to limit the numb of immigrant our nation can absorb it be also a manifest right of our government to set reasonable requirement on the character and the number of the people who come to share our land and our freedom it be good for us however to remind ourselves occasionally of a equally manifest fact we be one and all immigrant or son and daughter of immigrant exist legislation contain injustice it do in fact discriminate i be inform by member of the congress that it be realize at the time of its enactment that future study of the basis of determine quota would be necessary i be therefore request the congress to review this legislation and to enact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate national interest and be faithful to our basic idea of freedom and fairness to all in another but relate area that of social right we see much clearly the new application of old idea of freedom this administration be profoundly aware of two great need bear of our live in a complex industrial economy first the individual citizen must have safeguard against personal disaster inflict by force beyond his control 2 the welfare of the people demand effective and economical performance by the government of certain indispensable social service in the light of this responsibility certain general purpose and certain concrete measure be plainly indicate now there be urgent need for great effectiveness in our program both public and private offer safeguard against the privation that too often come with unemployment old age illness and accident the provision of the old age and survivor insurance law should promptly be extend to cover million of citizen who have be leave out of the social security system no little important be the encouragement of privately sponsor pension plan much important of all of course be renew effort to check the inflation which destroy so much of the value of all social security payment our school system demand some prompt effective help during each of the last year much than ѕ million child have swell the elementary and secondary school population of the country generally the school population be proportionately high in state with low per caput income this whole situation call for careful congressional study and action i be sure that you share my conviction that the firm condition of federal aid must be prove need and prove lack of local income one phase of the school problem demand special action the school population of many district have be greatly in crease by the swift growth of defense activity this activity have add little or nothing to the tax resource of the community affect legislation aid construction of school in the district expire on june this law should be renew and likewise the partial payment for current operate expense for this particular school district should be make include the deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year public interest similarly demand one prompt specific action in protection of the general consumer the food and drug administration should be authorize to continue its establish and necessary program of factory inspection the invalidation of this inspection by the supreme court of december be base solely on the fact that the present law contain inconsistent and unclear provision this must be promptly correct i be good aware that beyond this few immediate measure there remain much to be do the health and house need of our people call for intelligently plan program involve be the solvency of the whole security system and its guard against exploitation by the irresponsible to bring clear purpose and orderly procedure into this field i anticipate a thorough study of the proper relationship among federal state and local program i shall shortly send you specific recommendation for establish such a appropriate commission together with a reorganization plan define new administrative status for all federal activity in health education and social security i repeat that there be many important subject of which i make no mention today among this be our great and grow body of veteran america have traditionally be generous in care for the disable and the widow and the orphan of the fall this million remain close to all our heart proper care of our uniform citizen and appreciation of the past service of our veteran be part of our accept governmental responsibility xi we have survey briefly some problem of our people and a portion of the task before us the hope of freedom itself depend in real measure upon our strength our heart and our wisdom we must be strong in arm we must be strong in the source of all our armament our productivity we all worker and farmer foreman and financier technician and builder all must produce produce much and produce yet much we must be strong above all in the spiritual resource upon which all else depend we must be devote with all our heart to the value we defend we must know that each of this value and virtue apply with equal force at the end of the earth and in our relation with our neighbor next door we must know that freedom express itself with equal eloquence in the right of worker to strike in the nearby factory and in the yearning and suffering of the people of eastern europe as our heart summon our strength our wisdom must direct it there be in world affair a steady course to be follow between a assertion of strength that be truculent and a confession of helplessness that be cowardly there be in our affair at home a middle way between untrammeled freedom of the individual and the demand for the welfare of the whole nation this way must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoid neglect of the helpless in every area of political action free man must think before they can expect to win in this spirit must we live and labor confident of our strength compassionate in our heart clear in our mind in this spirit let us together turn to the great task before us mr president mr speaker member of the eighty 3 congress it be a high honor again to present to the congress my view on the state of the union and to recommend measure to advance the security prosperity and good be of the american people all branch of this government and i venture to say both of our great party can support the general objective of the

its history the damage effect of inflation on the wage pension salary and saving of us all have be bring under control tax have begin to go down the cost of our government have be reduce and its work proceed with some few employee thus the discourage trend of modern government toward their own limitless expansion have in our case be reverse the cost of armament become little oppressive as we near our defense goal yet we be militarily strong every day during the year creation of the new cabinet department of health education and welfare symbolize the government's permanent concern with the human problem of our citizen segregation in the arm force and other federal activity be on the way out we have also make progress toward its elimination in the district of columbia this be step in the

ever before american freedom be interlock with the freedom of other people in the unity of the free world lie our good chance to reduce the communist threat without war in the task of maintain this

shall promptly submit to the senate for its consent to ratification we be prepare to meet any renewal of arm aggression in korea we shall maintain indefinitely our base in okinawa i shall ask the

rebuttal it be a place where the nation of the world can if they have the will take collective action for peace and justice it be a place where the guilt can be squarely assign to that who fail to take all necessary step to keep the peace the unite nation deserve our continue firm support foreign assistance and trade in the practical application of our foreign policy we enter the field of foreign assistance and trade military assistance must be continue technical assistance must be maintain economic assistance can be reduce however our economic program in korea and in a few other critical place of the world be especially important and i shall ask congress to continue them in the next fiscal year the forthcoming budget message will propose maintenance of the presidential power of transferability of all assistance fund and will ask authority to merge this fund with the regular defense fund it will also propose that the secretary of defense have primary responsibility for the

that be plain to all thoughtful citizen that we be deal here with action akin to treason that when a citizen knowingly participate in the communist conspiracy he no long hold allegiance to the unite

position our military security and the standard of live of every citizen this administration be determine to keep our economy strong and to keep it grow at this moment we be in transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy i be confident that we can complete this transition without serious interruption in our economic growth but we shall not leave this vital matter to chance economic preparedness be fully as important to the nation as military preparedness subsequent special message and the economic report on january will set forth plan of the administration and its recommendation for congressional action this will include flexible credit and debt management policy tax measure to stimulate consumer and business spend suitable lend guarantee insure and grant in aid activity strengthen old age and unemployment insurance measure improve agricultural program public work plan lay good in advance enlarge opportunity for international trade and investment this mere enumeration of this subject imply the vast amount of study coordination and plan to say nothing of authorize legislation that altogether make our economic preparedness complete if new condition arise that require additional administrative or legislative action the administration will still be ready a government always ready as this be to take good time and vigorous action and a business community will as ours be to plan boldly and with confidence can between them develop a climate assure steady economic growth the budget i shall submit to the congress on january the first budget prepare by this administration for the period july through june this budget be adequate to the current need of the government it recognize that a federal budget should be a stabilize factor in the economy its tax and expenditure program will foster individual initiative and economic growth pend the transmittal of my budget message i shall mention here only a few point about our budgetary situation first one of our initial act be to revise with the cooperation of the congress the budget prepare before this administration take office request for new appropriation be greatly reduce in addition the spend level provide in that budget for the current fiscal year have be reduce by about in the next fiscal year we estimate a far reduction in expenditure of much than this will reduce the spend level over the two fiscal year by much than we be also reduce far our request for new appropriation 2 despite the substantial loss of revenue in the come fiscal year result from tax reduction now in effect and tax adjustment which i shall propose our reduce spend will move the new budget close to a balance 3 by keep new appropriation request below estimate revenue we continue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligation incur by the government under past appropriation 4 until that claim on our government's revenue be far reduce the growth in the public debt cannot be entirely stop because of this because the government's bill have to be pay every month while the tax money to pay them come in with great unevenness within the fiscal year and because of the need for flexibility to manage this enormous debt i find it necessary to renew my request for a increase in the statutory debt limit tax the new budget provide for a low level of taxation than have prevail in precede year six day ago individual income tax be reduce and the excess profit tax expire this tax reduction be justify only because of the substantial reduction we already have make and be make in governmental expenditure as additional reduction in expenditure be bring gradually but surely into sight far reduction in tax can and will be make when budget saving and sound governmental finance be assure tax burden should be reduce so that taxpayer may spend their own money in their own way while we be move toward low level of taxation we must thoroughly revise our whole tax system the groundwork for this revision have already be lay by the committee on way and mean of the house of representative in close consultation with the department of the treasury we should now remove the much glare tax inequity particularly on small taxpayer reduce restraint on the growth of small business and make other change that will encourage initiative enterprise and production twenty five recommendation toward this end will be contain in my budget message without attempt to summarize this manifold reform i can here illustrate their tendency for example we propose much liberal tax treatment for dependent child who work for widow or widower with dependent child and for medical expense for the business that want to expand or modernize its plant we propose liberalize tax treatment of depreciation research and development expense and retain earnings because of the present need for revenue the corporation income tax should be keep at the current rate of for another year and the excise tax schedule to be reduce on april first include that on liquor tobacco gasoline and automobile should be continue at present rate immediate extension of the renegotiation act of be also need to eliminate excessive profit and to prevent waste of public fund in the purchase of defense material agriculture the good be of our million people demand a stable and prosperous agriculture conversely every farmer know he cannot prosper unless all america prosper as we seek to promote increase in our standard of live we must be sure that the farmer fairly share in that increase therefore a farm program promote stability and prosperity in all element of our agriculture be urgently need agricultural law now in effect successfully accomplish their wartime purpose of encourage maximum production of many crop today production of this crop at such level far exceed present demand yet the law encourage such production be still in effect the storage facility of the commodity credit corporation bulge with surplus stock of dairy product wheat cotton corn and certain vegetable oil and the corporation's presently authorize borrow authority be nearly exhaust some product price out of domestic market and other price out of world market have pile up in government hand in a world in which million of people be hungry destruction of food would of course be unconscionable yet surplus stock continue to threaten the market and in spite of the acreage control authorize by present law surplus will continue to accumulate we confront two alternative the first be to impose still great acreage reduction for some crop and apply rigid federal control over the use of the divert acre this will regiment the production of every basic agricultural crop it will place every producer of that crop under the domination and control of the federal government in washington this alternative be contrary to the fundamental interest not only of the farmer but of the nation as a whole nor be it a real solution to the problem face us the 2 alternative be to permit the market price for this agricultural product gradually to have a great influence on the plan of production by farmer while continue the assistance of the government this be the sound approach to make it effective surplus exist when the new program begin must be insulate from the normal channel of trade for special use this use would include school lunch program disaster relief emergency assistance to foreign friend and of particular importance the stockpile of reserve for a national emergency build on the agricultural law of and we should establish a price support program with enough flexibility to attract the production of need supply of essential commodity and to stimulate the consumption of that commodity that be flood american market transition to modernize parity must be accomplish gradually in no case should there be a abrupt downward change in the dollar level or in the percentage level of price support next monday i shall transmit to the congress my detail recommendation embody this approach they have be develop through the cooperation of innumerable individual vitally interest in agriculture my special message on monday will briefly describe the consultative and advisory process to which this whole program have be subject during the past ten month i have choose this farm program because it will build market protect the consumer food supply and move food into consumption instead of into storage it be a program that will remove the threat to the farmer of this overhang surplus a program also that will stimulate production when a commodity be scarce and encourage consumption when nature be bountiful moreover it will promote the individual freedom responsibility and initiative which distinguish american agriculture and by help our agriculture achieve full parity in the market it promise our farmer a high and steady financial return over the year than any alternative plan conservation part of our nation's precious heritage be its natural resource it be the common responsibility of federal state and local government to improve and develop them always work in the close harmony and partnership all federal conservation and resource development project be be reappraise sound project now under way will be continue new project in which the federal government have a part must be economically sound with local share of cost wherever appropriate and feasible in the next fiscal year work will be start on twenty three project that meet this standard the federal government will continue to construct and operate economically sound flood control power irrigation and water supply project wherever this project be beyond the capacity of local initiative public or private and consistent with the need of the whole nation our conservation program will also take into account the important role play by farmer in protect our soil resource i recommend enactment of legislation to strengthen agricultural conservation and upstream flood prevention work and to achieve a good balance with major flood control structure in the down stream area recommendation will be make from time to time for the adoption of a uniform and consistent water resource policy a revise public land policy and a sound program for safeguard the domestic production of critical and strategic metal and mineral in addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forest park monument and other natural and historic site as good as our fishery and wildlife resource i hope that pend legislation to improve the conservation and management of publicly own graze land in national forest will soon be approve by the congress national highway to protect the vital interest of every citizen in a safe and adequate highway system the federal government be continue its central role in the federal aid highway program so that maximum progress can be make to overcome present inadequacy in the interstate highway system we must continue the federal gasoline tax at two cent per gallon this will require cancellation of the ѕў decrease which otherwise will become effective april 1st and will maintain revenue so that a expand highway program can be undertake when the commission on intergovernmental relation complete its study of the present system of finance highway construction i shall promptly submit it for consideration by the congress and the governor of the state post office it be apparent that the substantial saving already make and to be make by the post office department cannot eliminate the postal deficit i recommend therefore that the congress approve the bill now pend in the house of representative provide for the adjustment of certain postal rate to handle the long term aspect of this i also recommend that the congress create a permanent commission to establish fair and reasonable postal rate from time to time in the future iii human problem along with the protection of freedom and maintenance of a strong and grow economy this administration recognize a 3 great purpose of government concern for the human problem of our citizen in a modern industrial society banishment of destitution and cushion the shock of personal disaster on the individual be proper concern of all level of government include the federal government this be especially true where remedy and prevention alike be beyond the individual's capacity labor and welfare of the many problem in this area that i shall first discuss be of particular concern to the member of our great labor force who with their head heart and hand produce so much of the wealth of our country protection against the hazard of temporary unemployment should be extend to some 6ѕ million of worker include civilian federal worker who now lack this safeguard moreover the secretary of labor be make available to the state study and recommendation in the field of weekly benefit period of protection and extension of coverage the economic report will consider the relate matter of minimum wage and their coverage the labor management relation act of be basically a sound law however six year of experience have reveal that in some respect it can be improve on january i shall forward to the congress suggestion for change design to reinforce the basic objective of the act our basic social security program the old age and survivor insurance system to which individual contribute during their productive year and receive benefit base on previous earnings be design to

improvement in the insurance system will bring substantial benefit increase and broaden the membership of the insurance system thus diminish the need for federal grant in aid for such purpose a new formula will therefore be propose permit progressive reduction in such grant as the need for them decline federal grant in aid welfare program now base on widely vary formula should be simplify concrete proposal on fourteen of them will be suggest to the appropriate committee the program for rehabilitation of the disable especially need strengthen through special vocational train this program presently return each year some handicap individual to productive work far much disable people can be save each year from idleness and dependence if this program be gradually increase my much detail recommendation on this and the other social insurance problem i have mention will be send to the congress on january 14th health i be flatly oppose to the socialization of medicine the great need for hospital and medical service can good be meet by the initiative of private plan but it be unfortunately a fact that medical cost be rise and already impose severe hardship on many family the federal government can do many helpful thing and still carefully avoid the socialization of medicine the federal government should encourage medical research in its battle with such mortal disease as cancer and heart ailment and should continue to help the state in their health and rehabilitation program the present hospital survey and construction act should be broaden in order to assist in the development of adequate facility for the chronically ill and to encourage the construction of diagnostic center rehabilitation facility and nurse home the war on disease also need a good work relationship between government and private initiative private and non profit hospital and medical insurance plan be already in the field soundly base on the experience and initiative of the people in

it on january i shall forward to the congress a special message present this administration's health program in its detail education youth our great resource be be seriously neglect in a vital respect the nation as a whole be not prepare teacher or build school fast enough to keep up with the increase in our population the preparation of teacher as indeed the control and direction of public education policy be a state and local responsibility however the federal government should stand ready to assist state which demonstrably cannot provide sufficient school building in order to appraise the need i hope that this year a conference on education will be hold in each state culminate in a national conference from this conference on education every level of government from the federal government to each local school board should gain the information with which to attack this serious problem house the detail of a program to enlarge and improve the opportunity for our people to

participate in the political process that produce this fateful summon i urge congress to propose to the state a constitutional amendment permit citizen to vote when they reach the age of conclusion i want to add one final word about the general purport of this many recommendation our government's power be wisely limit by the constitution but quite apart from that limitation there be thing which no government can do or should try to do a government can strive as ours be strive to maintain a economic system whose door be open to enterprise and ambition that personal quality on which economic growth largely depend but enterprise and ambition be quality which no government can supply fortunately no american government need concern itself on this score our people have this quality in good measure a government can sincerely strive for peace as ours be strive and ask its people to make sacrifice for the sake of peace but no government can place peace in the heart of foreign ruler it be our duty then to ourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all that way spiritual economic military that will give us maximum safety against the possibility of aggressive action by other no government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that plague our age happily our people though bless with much material good than any people in history have always reserve their first allegiance to the kingdom of the spirit which be the true source of that freedom we value above all material thing but a government can try as ours try to sense the deep aspiration of the people and to express them in political action at home and abroad so long as action and aspiration humbly and earnestly seek favor in the sight of the almighty there be no end to america's forward road there be no obstacle on it she will not surmount in her march toward a last peace in a free and prosperous world mr president mr speaker member of the congress first i extend cordial greeting to the 84th

among this broad purpose of government be our support of freedom justice and peace it be of the utmost importance that each of us understand the true nature of the struggle now take place in the world

than the angel crown with glory and honor hold dominion over the work of his creator or man be a soulless animate machine to be enslave use and consume by the state for its own glorification it be therefore a struggle which go to the root of the human spirit and its shadow fall across the long sweep of man's destiny this prize so precious so fraught with ultimate mean be the true object of the contend force in the world in the past year there have be progress justify hope both for continue peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the world free nation be collectively strong

major battlefield on earth this same fact inspire us to work all the much effectively with other nation for the good be the freedom the dignity of every human on earth this development be hearten indeed and we be hopeful of continue progress but sober problem remain the massive military machine and ambition of the soviet communist bloc still create uneasiness in the world all of us be aware of the continue reliance of the soviet communist on military force of the power of their weapon of their present resistance to realistic armament limitation and of their continue effort to dominate or intimidate free nation on their periphery their steadily grow power include a increase strength in nuclear weapon this power combine with the proclaim intention of the communist leader to communize the world be the threat confront us today to protect our nation and our people from the catastrophe of a nuclear holocaust free nation must maintain countervail military power to persuade the communist of the futility of seek their end through aggression if communist ruler understand that america's response to aggression will be swift and decisive that never shall we buy peace at the expense of honor or faith they will be powerfully deter from launch a military venture engulf their own people and many other in disaster this of course be merely world stalemate but in this stalemate each of us may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for endure peace the military threat be but one menace to our freedom and security we must not only deter aggression we must also frustrate the effort of communist to gain their goal by subversion to this end free nation must maintain and reinforce their cohesion their internal security their political and economic vitality and their faith in freedom in such a world america's course be dear we must tirelessly labor to make the peace much just and durable we must strengthen the collective defense under the unite

strengthen the unite nation at this very moment by vote of the unite nation general assembly its secretary general be in communist china on a mission of deep concern to all american seek the release of our never to be forget american aviator and all other unite nation prisoner wrongfully detain by the communist regime we must also encourage the effort be make in the unite nation to limit armament and to harness the atom to peaceful rise we must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly nation whose own good effort be still insufficient to provide the strength essential to the security of the free world we must be will to use the process of negotiation whenever they will advance the cause of just and secure peace to which the unite state and other free nation be dedicate in respect to all this matter we must through a vigorous information program keep the people of the world truthfully advise of our action and purpose this problem have be attack with new vigor during the past month i urge that the congress give its earnest consideration to the great advantage that can accrue to our country through the successful operation of this program we must also carry forward our educational exchange program this share of knowledge and experience between our citizen and that of free country be a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true partnership among free people to advance this many effort the congress must act in this session on appropriation legislation and treaty today i shall mention especially our foreign economic and military program the recent economic progress in many free nation have be much hearten the productivity of labor and the production of good and service be increase in ever widen area there be a grow will to improve the live standard of all man this progress be important to all our people it promise us ally who be strong and self reliant it promise a grow world market for the product of our mine our factory and our farm but only through steady effort can we hope to continue this progress barrier still impede trade and the flow of capital need to develop each nation's human and material resource wise reduction of this barrier be a long term objective of our foreign economic policy a policy of a evolutionary and selective nature assure broad benefit to our own and other people we must gradually reduce certain tariff obstacle to trade this action should of course be accompany by a similar lower of trade barrier by other nation so that we may move steadily toward great economic advantage for all we must far simplify custom administration and procedure we must facilitate the flow of capital and continue technical assistance both directly and through the unite nation to little develop country to strengthen their independence and raise their live standard many another step must be take in and among the nation of the free world to release force of private initiative in our own nation this force have bring strength and prosperity once release they will generate rise income in this other country with which to buy the product of american industry labor and agriculture on january by special message i shall submit specific recommendation for carry forward the legislative phase of our foreign economic policy our many effort to build a good world include the maintenance of our military strength this be a vast undertake major national security program consume two third of the entire federal budget over four million american serviceman and civilian be on the roll of the defense establishment during the past two year by eliminate duplication and overstaffing by improve procurement and inventory control and by concentrate on the essential many billion of dollar have be save in our defense activity i should like to mention certain fundamental underlie this vast program first a realistic limitation of armament and a endure just peace remain our national goal we maintain powerful military force because there be no present alternative force design for deterrent and defensive purpose alone but able instantly to strike back with destructive power in response to a attack 2 we must stay alert to the fact that undue reliance on one weapon or preparation for only one kind of warfare simply invite a enemy to resort to another we must therefore keep in our arm force balance and flexibility adequate for our purpose and objective 3 to keep our arm force abreast of the advance of science our military plan must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapon and technique which flow ever much speedily from our research and development program the forthcoming military budget therefore emphasize modern airpower in the air force navy and marine corp and increase the emphasis on new weapon especially that of rapid and destructive strike power it assure the maintenance of effective retaliatory force as the principal deterrent to overt aggression it accelerate the continental defense program and the build up of ready military reserve force it continue a vigorous program of stockpile strategic and critical material and strengthen our mobilization base the budget also contemplate the strategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain force it provide for reduction of force in certain category and their expansion in other to fit them to the military reality of our time this emphasis in our defense plan have be make at my personal direction after long and thoughtful study in my judgment they will give our nation a defense accurately adjust to the national need 4 pend a world agreement on armament limitation we must continue to improve and expand our supply of nuclear weapon for our land naval and air force while at the same time continue our encourage progress in the peaceful use of atomic power and 5 in the administration of this costly program we must demand the utmost in efficiency and ingenuity we must assure our people not only of adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carry forward from year to year until the threat of aggression have disappear to help maintain this kind of arm strength and improve its efficiency i must urge the enactment of several important measure in this session the first concern the selective service act which expire next june 30th for the foreseeable future our stand force must remain much large than voluntary method can sustain we must therefore extend the statutory authority to induct man for two year of military service the 2 kind of measure concern the rapid turnover of our much experience serviceman this process seriously weaken the combat readiness of our arm force and be exorbitantly expensive to encourage much train serviceman to remain in uniform i shall on the 13 of this month propose a numb of measure to increase the attraction of a military career this measure will include much adequate medical care for dependent survivor benefit much and good house and selective adjustment in military pay and other allowance and 3 also on january i shall present a program to rebuild and strengthen the civilian component of our arm force this be a comprehensive program design to make good use of our manpower of military age because it will go far in assure fair and equitable participation in military train and service it be of particular importance to our combat veteran in keep with the historic military policy of our republic this program be design to build and maintain powerful civilian reserve immediately capable of effective military service in a emergency in lieu of maintain active duty force in excess of the nation's immediate need maintenance of a effective defense require continuance of our aggressive attack on subversion at home in this effort we have in the past two year make excellent progress fbi investigation have be powerfully reinforce by a new internal security division in the department of justice the security activity of the immigration and naturalization service have be revitalize a improve and strengthen security system be in effect throughout the government the department of justice and the fbi have be arm with effective new legal weapon forge by the 83rd congress we shall continue to ferret out and to destroy communist subversion we shall in the process carefully preserve our tradition and the basic right of our citizen our civil defense program be also a key element in the protection of our country we be develop cooperative method with state governor mayor and voluntary citizen group as good as among federal agency in build the civil defense organization its significance in time of war be obvious its swift assistance in disaster area last year prove its importance in time of peace a industry capable of rapid expansion and essential material and facility swiftly available in time of emergency be indispensable to our defense i urge therefore a two year extension of the defense production act and title ii of the first war power act of this be cornerstone of our program for the development and maintenance of a adequate mobilization base at this point i should like to make this additional observation our quest for peace and freedom necessarily presume that we who hold position of public trust must rise above self and section that we must subordinate to the general good our partisan our personal pride and prejudice tirelessly with unite purpose we must fortify the material and spiritual foundation of this land of freedom and of free nation throughout the world as never before there be need for unhesitating cooperation among the branch of our government at this time the executive and legislative branch be under the management of different political party this fact place both party on trial before the american people in little perilous day of the past division of governmental responsibility among our great party have produce a paralyze indecision we must not let this happen in our time we must avoid a paralysis of the will for peace and international security in the traditionally bipartisan area military security and foreign relation i can report to you that i have already with the leader of this congress express assurance of unreserved cooperation yet the strength of our country require much than mere maintenance of military strength and success in foreign affair this vital matter be in turn dependent upon concerted and vigorous action in a numb of support program i say therefore to the 84th congress in all area basic to the strength

of our economy and to protect the integrity of the people's money today i shall discuss this program only in general term government efficiency and economy remain essential to steady progress toward a balance budget much than ten billion dollar be cut from the spend program propose in the budget of january expenditure of that year be six and a half billion below that of the previous year in the current fiscal year government spend will be nearly four and a half billion dollar little than in the fiscal year which end last june new spend authority have be hold below expenditure reduce government obligation accumulate over the year last year we have a large tax cut and for the first time in seventy five year a basic revision of federal tax law it be now clear that defense and other essential government cost must remain at a level preclude far tax reduction this year although excise and corporation income tax must therefore be continue at their present rate far tax cut will be possible when justify by low expenditure and by revenue increase arise from the nation's economic growth i be hopeful that such reduction can be make next year at the foundation of our economic growth be the raw material and energy produce from our mineral and fuel land and forest and water resource with respect to them i believe that the nation must adhere to three fundamental policy first to develop wisely use and conserve basic resource from generation to generation 2 to follow the historic pattern of develop this resource primarily by private citizen under fair provision of law include restraint for proper conservation and 3 to treat resource development as a partnership undertake a partnership in which the participation of private citizen and state and local government be as necessary as federal participation this policy of partnership and cooperation be produce good result much immediately noticeable in respect to water resource first it have encourage local public body and private citizen to plan their own power source increase number of application to the federal power commission to conduct survey and prepare plan for power development notably in the columbia river basin be evidence of local response 2 the federal government and local and private organization have be encourage to coordinate their development this be important because federal hydroelectric development supply but a small fraction of the nation's power need such partnership project as priest rapid in washington the coosa river development in alabama and markham ferry in oklahoma already have the approval of the congress this year justifiable project of a similar nature will again have administration support 3 the federal government must shoulder its own partnership obligation by undertake project of such complexity and size that their success require federal development in keep with this principle i again urge the congress to approve the development of the upper colorado river basin to conserve and assure good use of precious water essential to the future of the west in addition the budget will recommend appropriation to start six new reclamation and much than thirty new corp of engineer project of vary size go project and investigation of potential new resource development will be continue although this partnership approach be produce encourage result its full success require a nation wide comprehensive water resource policy firmly base in law such a policy be under preparation and when complete will be submit to the congress in the interest of their proper conservation development and use continue vigilance will be maintain over our fishery wildlife resource the national park and forest and the public land and we shall continue to encourage a orderly development of the nation's mineral resource a modern efficient highway system be essential to meet the need of our grow population our expand economy and our national security we be accelerate our highway improvement program as rapidly as possible under exist state and federal law and authorization however this effort will not in itself assure our people of a adequate highway system on my recommendation this problem have be carefully consider by the conference of state governor and by a special advisory committee on a national highway program compose of lead private citizen i have receive the recommendation of the governor conference and will shortly receive the view of the special advisory committee aid by their finding i shall submit on january 27th detail recommendation

executive branch of the government in modern time we be not only examine major problem face the various mode of transport we be also study closely the inter relationship of civilian and government requirement for transportation legislation will be recommend to correct policy deficiency which we may find the nation's public work activity be tremendous in scope it be expect that much than billion will be expend in for the development of land water and other resource control of flood and navigation and harbor improvement construction of road school and municipal water supply and disposal of domestic and industrial waste many of the federal state and local agency responsible for this work be in their separate capacity highly efficient but public work activity be closely inter relate and have a substantial influence on the growth of the country moreover in time of threaten economic contraction they may become a valuable sustain force to this end efficient plan and execution of the nation's public work require both the coordination of federal activity and effective cooperation with state and local government the council of economic adviser through its public work plan section have make important advance during the past year in effect this coordination and cooperation in view of the success of this initial effort and to give much emphasis and continuity to this essential coordination i shall request the congress to appropriate fund for the support of a office of coordinator of public work in the executive office of the president a much significant element in our grow economy be a agriculture that be stable prosperous and free the problem of our agriculture have evolve over many year and cannot be solve overnight nevertheless governmental action last year hold

my 3 annual message on the state of the union it be a long document and contain a review of the accomplishment of the past three year as good as many recommendation for the far advancement of our country in the year to come now that thing that have be accomplish be important and one of the chief ingredient in the achievement we have make be the cooperation that have exist between the congress and the executive department in the federal government some of that result i will enumerate only briefly the first be the fact that we be at peace the peace be not always the kind that we should like one in which we have complete confidence but still there be no shoot war we have the good security posture we have ever have during year of peace government spend have be cut much than ten billion dollar annually tax have be reduce tax be reduce at a time when we be pass from a war to a peace economy and the great tax reduction of that year be make so as to stimulate peacetime activity to take the place of the former wartime production the national economy in the general picture be in very splendid shape the national income be at a all time high with the high standard of live we have ever enjoy the product of our great industrial plant be much widely distribute and the profit from it much people be work the only two thing in this economic picture that seem to need immediate and drastic attention be first the depress area where peacetime activity have not catch up with past wartime activity and the other be in the farm community where there be of course a serious problem exist now to mention only a very few of the recommendation that the message make to the congress i want to point out that first we be govern by five major objective the first of this be the discharge of our world responsibility in discharge that responsibility we seek first a peace for all nation good know that no nation can have peace by itself we of course must be very careful in watch the tactic of the communist at time they smile and at time they seem to threaten our own purpose be to remain steadfast in the pursuit of a world peace base on justice and not to be hysterical under their threat or to be beguile too much by their smile we intend to continue strengthen our ally and we intend to continue the honest search for disarmament we will not be satisfy with anything in the disarmament line though that be not mutual and a system in which we can have confidence we of course seek the constant improvement of our national security through the improvement and development of the much modern of weapon through the save of man and as i say before we have the high level of national security we have ever have in this line defense arrangement include not only our ally but our own continental defense and the power to strike where need be the next objective be to maintain the fiscal integrity of the government this mean that we must balance our budget i have every expectation that june will show a balance budget for this fiscal year moreover the budget that i be send to congress will contemplate a balance of the budget also in all of this have be do without reduction of the security arrangement or in the sum devote to mutual aid throughout the world in this connection i should mention our enormous national debt we must begin to make some payment on it if we be to avoid pass on to our child a impossible burden of debt and we will not talk about any reduction of any other kind until we have begin to make some modest payment on that the 4 objective of the program that we be submit to the congress be to foster a ever expand economy i have already mention that direction in which we be achieve new standard in our productivity but i also mention that we be behind in one or two phase of the economy and the much important of this be agriculture i be send a special message on this subject to the congress on monday next it will contain many new proposal for expand the program under which we have be operate in the agricultural field particularly new point will be the establishment of a soil bank which will help remove acreage from production and on a basis that will be of assistance to the farmer immediately we be go to help remove much control from the farmer we be go to go into a program of expand research into the rural development program to help low income farmer and there will be a new great plain program in this same field there will be new highway legislation propose and new plan for resource conservation and protection against disaster in flood and other area there will be a area development plan to assist that region which be backward in their economy because of failure to make necessary change in recent year now there be one other field and that be another principal objective and that be a program that be design to respond to human need throughout the nation this include school construction old age and survivor insurance medical research health re insurance labor law for expand the minimum wage law and for correct certain deficiency in the wagehour law for house include a two year program for public house and for immigration revision now this be just a few of the item that be in the message you will see in your daily newspaper if you care to look a great detail explanation of the thing to which i be so hurriedly refer but i do pledge the administration to this we be go to foster the march of science in help expand our economy and increase productivity we be go to be certain about the security of the unite state in this world of today we be go to continue to seek a just peace and we be go to devote single mind attention to the common good of america all its citizen goodnight to the congress of the unite state i appear before the congress today to report on the state of the union and the relationship of the union to the other nation of the world i come here firmly convince that at no time in the history of the republic have circumstance much emphatically underscore the need in all echelon of government for vision and wisdom and resolution you meet in a season of stress that be test the fitness of political system and the validity of political philosophy each stress stem in part from cause peculiar to itself but every stress be a reflection of a universal phenomenon in the world today the surge and understandable tide of nationalism be mark by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny injustice inequality and poverty as individual join in a common hunger for freedom man and woman and even child pit their spirit against gun and tank on a large scale in a ever much persistent search for the self respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which national independence must rest people sever old tie seek new alliance experiment sometimes dangerously in their struggle to satisfy this human aspiration particularly in the past year this tide have change the pattern of attitude and think among million the change already accomplish foreshadow a world transform by the spirit of freedom this be no faint and pious hope the force now at work in the mind and heart of man will not be spend through many year in the main today's expression of nationalism be in spirit echo of our forefather struggle for independence this republic cannot be aloof to this event herald a new epoch in the affair of mankind our pledge word our enlighten self interest our character as a nation commit us to a high role in world affair a role of vigorous leadership ready strength sympathetic understand the state of the union at the open of the 85th congress continue to vindicate the wisdom of the principle on which this republic be round proclaim in the constitution of the nation and in many of our historic document and round in devout religious conviction this principle enunciate a vigilant regard for human liberty a wise concern for human welfare a ceaseless effort for human progress fidelity to this principle in our relation with other people have win us new friendship and have increase our opportunity for service within the family of nation the appeal of this principle be universal light fire in the soul of man everywhere we shall continue to uphold them against that who deny them and in counsel with our friend at home the application of this principle to the complex problem of our national life have bring us to a unprecedented peak in our economic prosperity and have exemplify in our way of life the endure human value of mind and spirit through the past four year this principle have guide the legislative program submit by the administration to the congress as we attempt to apply them to current event domestic and foreign we must take into account the complex entity that be the unite state of america what endanger it what can improve it the visible structure be our american economy itself after much than a century and a half of constant expansion it be still rich in a wide variety of natural resource it be first among nation in its people s mastery of industrial skill it be productive beyond our own need of many foodstuff and industrial product it be reward to all our citizen in opportunity to earn and to advance in self realization and in self expression it be fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural and religious center it be vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative and willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise it be productive of a widely share prosperity our economy be strong expand and fundamentally sound but in any realistic appraisal even the optimistic analyst will realize that in a prosperous period the principal threat to efficient function of a free enterprise system be inflation we look back on four year of prosperous activity during which price the cost of live have be relatively stable that be inflation have be hold in check but it be clear that the danger be always present particularly if the government may become profligate in its expenditure or private group may ignore all the possible result on our economy of unwise struggle for immediate gain this danger require a firm resolution that the federal government shall utilize only a prudent share of the nation's resource that it shall live within its mean carefully measure against need alternative proposal for expenditure through the next four year i shall continue to insist that the executive department and agency of government search out additional way to save money and manpower i urge that the congress be equally watchful in this matter we pledge the government's share in guard the integrity of the dollar but the government's effort cannot be the entire campaign against inflation the thief that can rob the individual of the value of the pension and social security he have earn during his productive life for success government's effort must be parallel by the attitude and action of individual citizen i have often speak of the purpose of this administration to serve the national interest of million people the national interest must take precedence over temporary advantage which may be secure by particular group at the expense of all the people in this regard i call on leader in business and in labor to think good on their responsibility to the american people with all element of our society they owe the nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary tendency that be always at work in a dynamic economy operate at today's high level they can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such tendency by their wage and price policy business in its price policy should avoid unnecessary price increase especially at a time like the present when demand in so many area press hard on short supply a reasonable profit be essential to the new investment that provide much job in a expand economy but business leader must in the national interest studiously avoid that price rise that be possible only because of vital or unusual need of the whole nation if our economy be to remain healthy increase in wage and other labor benefit negotiate by labor and management must be reasonably relate to improvement in productivity such increase be beneficial for they provide wage earner with great purchase power except where necessary to correct obvious injustice wage increase that outrun productivity however be a inflationary factor they make for high price for the public generally and impose a particular hardship on that whose welfare depend on the purchase power of retirement income and saving wage negotiation should also take cognizance of the right of the public generally to share in the benefit of improvement in technology freedom have be define as the opportunity for self discipline this definition have a special application to the area of wage and price policy in a free economy should we persistently fail to discipline ourselves eventually there will be increase pressure on government to redress the failure by that process freedom will step by step disappear no subject on the domestic scene should much attract the concern of the friend of american work man and woman and of free business enterprise than the force that threaten a steady depreciation of the value of our money concern development in another vital sector of our economy agriculture i be gratify that the long slide in farm income have be halt and that far improvement be in prospect this be hearten progress three tool that we have develop improve surplus disposal improve price support law and the soil bank be work to reduce price depress government stock of farm product our concern for the good be of farm family demand that we constantly search for new way by which they can share much fully in our unprecedented prosperity legislative recommendation in the field of agriculture be contain in the budget message our soil water mineral forest fish and wildlife resource be be conserve and improve much effectively their conservation and development be vital to the present and future strength of the nation but they must not be the concern of the federal government alone state and local entity and private enterprise should be encourage to participate in such project i would like to make special mention of program for make the good use of water rapidly become our much precious natural resource just as it can be when neglect a destroyer of both life and wealth there have be prepare and publish a comprehensive water report develop by a cabinet committee and relate to all phase of this particular problem in the light of this report there be two thing i believe we should keep constantly in mind the first be that each of our great river valley should be consider as a whole piecemeal operation within each lesser drainage area can be self defeat or at the very less needlessly expensive the 2 be that the domestic and industrial demand for water grow far much rapidly than do our population the whole matter of make the good use of each drop of water from the moment it touch our soil until it reach the ocean for such purpose as irrigation flood control power production and domestic and industrial use clearly demand the close kind of cooperation and partnership between municipality state and the federal government through partnership of federal state and local authority in this vast project we can obtain the economy and efficiency of development and operation that spring from a lively sense of local responsibility until such partnership be establish on a proper and logical basis of share authority responsibility and cost our country will never have both the fully productive use of water that it so obviously need and protection against disastrous flood if we fail in this all the many task that need to be do in america can be accomplish only at a excessive cost by the growth of a stifle bureaucracy and eventually with a dangerous degree of centralize control over our national life in all domestic matter i believe that the people of the unite state will expect of us effective action to remedy past failure in meet critical need high priority should be give the school construction bill this will benefit child of all race throughout the country and child of all race need school now a program design to meet emergency need for much classroom should be enact without delay i be hopeful that this program can be enact on its own merit uncomplicated by provision deal with the complex problem of integration i urge the people in all section of the country to approach this problem with calm and reason with mutual understand and good will and in the american tradition of deep respect for the orderly process of law and justice i should say here that we have much reason to be proud of the progress our people be make in mutual understand the chief buttress of human and civil right steadily we be move close to the goal of fair and equal treatment of citizen without regard to race or color but unhappily much remain to be do last year the administration recommend to the congress a four point program to reinforce civil right that program include creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate assert violation of civil right and to make recommendation creation of a civil right division in the department of justice in charge of a assistant attorney general enactment by the congress of new law to aid in the enforcement of vote right and amendment of the law so as to permit the federal government to seek from the civil court preventive relief in civil right case i urge that the congress enact this legislation essential to the stable economic growth we seek be a system of good adapt and efficient financial institution i believe the time have come to conduct a broad national inquiry into the nature performance and adequacy of our financial system both in term of its direct service to the whole economy and in term of its function as the mechanism through which monetary and credit policy take effect i believe the congress should authorize the creation of a commission of able and qualify citizen to undertake this vital inquiry out of their finding and recommendation the administration would develop and present to the congress any legislative proposal that may be indicate for the purpose of improve our financial machinery in this message it seem unnecessary that i should repeat recommendation involve our domestic affair that have be urge upon the congress during the past four year but which in some instance do not reach the stage of completely satisfactory legislation the administration will through future message either directly from me or from head of the department and agency transmit to the congress specific recommendation this will involve our financial and fiscal affair our military and civil defense the administration of justice our agricultural economy our domestic and foreign commerce the urgently need increase in our postal rate the development of our natural resource our labor law include our labor management relation legislation and vital aspect of the health education and welfare of our people there will be special recommendation deal with such subject as atomic energy the further of public work the continue effort to eliminate government competition with the business of tax pay citizen a numb of legislative recommendation will be mention specifically in my forthcoming budget message which will reach you within the week that message will also recommend such sum as be need to implement the propose action turn to the international scene the existence of a strongly arm imperialistic dictatorship pose a continue threat to the free world's and thus to our own nation's security and peace there be certain truth to be remember here first america alone and isolate cannot assure even its own security we must be join by the capability and resolution of nation that have prove themselves dependable defender of freedom isolation from them invite war our security be also enhance by the immeasurable interest that join us with all people who believe that peace with justice must be preserve that war of aggression be crime against humanity another truth be that our survival in today's world require modern adequate dependable military strength our nation have make great stride in assure a modern defense so arm in new weapon so deploy so equip that today our security force be the much powerful in our peacetime history it can punish heavily any enemy who undertake to attack us it be a major deterrent to war by our research and development much efficient weapon some of amaze capability be be constantly create this vital effort we shall continue yet we must not delude ourselves that safety necessarily increase as expenditure for military research or force in be go up indeed beyond a wise and reasonable level which be always change and be under constant study money spend on arm may be money waste on sterile metal or inflate cost thereby weaken the very security and strength we seek national security require far much than military power economic and moral factor play indispensable role any program that endanger our economy can defeat us any weaken of our national will and resolution any diminution of the vigor and initiative of our individual citizen would strike a blow at the heart of our defense the fine military establishment we can produce must work closely in cooperation with the force of our friend our system of regional pact develop within the charter of the unite nation serve to increase both our own security and the security of other nation this system be still a recent introduction on the world scene its problem be many and difficult because it insist on equality among its member and bring into association some nation traditionally divide repeatedly in recent month the collapse of this regional alliance have be predict the strain upon them have be at time indeed severe despite this strain our regional alliance have prove durable and strong and dire prediction of their disintegration have prove completely false with other free nation we should vigorously prosecute measure that will promote mutual strength prosperity and welfare within the free world strength be essentially a product of economic health and social good be consequently even as we continue our program of military assistance we must emphasize aid to our friend in build much productive economy and in good satisfy the natural demand of their people for progress thereby we shall move a long way toward a peaceful world a sound and safeguard agreement for open sky unarmed aerial sentinel and reduce armament would provide a valuable contribution toward a durable peace in the year ahead and we have be persistent in our effort to reach such a agreement we be will to enter any reliable agreement which would reverse the trend toward ever much devastate nuclear weapon reciprocally provide against the possibility of surprise attack mutually control the outer space missile and satellite development and make feasible a low level of armament and arm force and a easy burden of military expenditure our continue negotiation in this field be a major part of our quest for a confident peace in this atomic age this quest require as good a constructive attitude among all the nation of the free world toward expansion of trade and investment that can give all of us opportunity to work out economic betterment a essential step in this field be the provision of a administrative agency to insure the orderly and proper operation of exist arrangement trader which multilateral trade be now carry on to that end i urge congressional authorization for unite state membership in the propose organization for trade cooperation a action which will speed removal of discrimination against our export trade we welcome the effort of a numb of our european friend to achieve a integrate community to develop a common market we likewise welcome their cooperative effort in the field of atomic energy to demonstrate once again our unalterable purpose to make of the atom a peaceful servant of humanity i shortly shall ask the congress to authorize full unite state participation in the international atomic energy agency world event have magnify both the responsibility and the opportunity of the unite state information agency just as in recent month the voice of communism have become much shake and confuse the voice of truth must be much clearly hear to enable our information agency to cope with this new responsibility and opportunity i be ask the congress to increase appreciably the appropriation for this program and for legislation establish a career service for the agency's overseas foreign service officer the recent historic event in hungary demand that all free nation share to the extent of their capability in the responsibility of grant asylum to victim of communist persecution i request the congress promptly to enact legislation to regularize the status in the unite state of hungarian refugee bring here as parolees i shall shortly recommend to the congress by special message the change in our immigration law that i deem necessary in the light of our world responsibility the cost of peace be something we must face boldly fearlessly beyond money it involve change in attitude the renunciation of old prejudice even the sacrifice of some seem self interest only five day ago i express to you the grave concern of your government over the threat of soviet aggression in the middle east i ask for congressional authorization to help counter this threat i say again that this matter be of vital and immediate importance to the nation's and the free world's security and peace by our propose program in the middle east we hope to assist in establish a climate in which constructive and long term solution to basic problem of the area may be seek from time to time there will be present to the congress request for other legislation in the broad field of international affair all request will reflect the steadfast purpose of this administration to pursue peace base on justice although in some case detail will be new the underlie purpose and objective will remain the same all proposal make by the administration in this field be base on the free world's unity this unity may not be immediately obvious unless we examine link by link the chain of relationship that bind us to every area and to every nation in spirit the free world be one because its people uphold the right of independent existence for all nation i have already allude to their economic interdependence but their interdependence extend also into the field of security first of all no reasonable man will question the absolute need for our american neighbor to be prosperous and secure their security and prosperity be inextricably bind to our own and we be of course already join with this neighbor by historic pledge again no reasonable man will deny that the freedom and prosperity and security of western europe be vital to our own prosperity and security if the institution the skill the manpower of its people be to fall under the domination of a aggressive imperialism the violent change in the balance of world power and in the pattern of world commerce can not be fully compensate for by any american measure military or economic but this people whose economic strength be largely dependent on free and uninterrupted movement of oil from the middle east cannot prosper indeed their economy would be severely impair should that area be control by a enemy and the movement of oil be subject to its decision next to the eastward be asiatic and far eastern people recently return to independent control of their own affair or now emerge into sovereign statehood their potential strength constitute new assurance for stability and peace in the world if they can retain their independence should they lose freedom and be dominate by a aggressor the world wide effect would imperil the security of the free world in short the world have so shrink that all free nation be our neighbor without cooperative neighbor the unite state cannot maintain its own security and welfare because first america's vital interest be world wide embrace both hemisphere and every continent 2 we have community of interest with every nation in the free world 3 interdependence of interest require a decent respect for the right and the peace of all people this principle motivate our action within the unite nation there before all the world by our loyalty to them by our practice of them let us strive to set a standard to which all who seek justice and who hunger for peace can rally may we at home here at the seat of government in all the city and town and farmland of america support this principle in a personal effort of dedication thereby each of us can help establish a secure world order in which opportunity for freedom and justice will be much widespread and in which the resource now dissipate on the armament of war can be release for the life and growth of all humanity when our forefather prepare the immortal document that proclaim our independence they assert that every individual be endow by his creator with certain inalienable right as we gaze back through history to that date it be clear that our nation have strive to live up to this declaration apply it to nation as good as to individual today we proudly assert that the government of the unite state be still commit to this concept both in its activity at home and abroad the purpose be divine the implementation be human our country and its government have make mistake human mistake they have be of the head not of the heart and it be still true that the great concept of the dignity of all man alike create in the image of the almighty have be the compass by which we have try and be try to steer our course so long as we continue by its guidance there will be true progress in human affair both among ourselves and among that with whom we deal to achieve a much perfect fidelity to it i submit be a worthy ambition as we meet together in this first day of this the first session of the 85th congress mr president mr speaker member of the 85th congress it be again my high privilege to extend personal greeting to the member of the 85th congress all of us realize that as this new session begin many american be trouble about recent world development which they believe may threaten our nation's safety honest man differ in their appraisal of america's material and intellectual strength and the danger that confront us but all know this danger be real the purpose of this message be to outline the measure that can give the american people a confidence just as real in their own security i be not here to justify the past gloss over the problem of the present or propose easy solution for the future i be here to state what i believe to be right and what i believe to be wrong and to propose action for correct what i think wrong i there be two task confront us that so far outweigh all other that i shall devote this year's message entirely to them the first be to ensure our safety through strength as to our strength i have repeatedly voice this conviction we now have a broadly base and efficient defensive strength include a great deterrent power which be for the present our main guarantee against war but unless we act wisely and promptly we can lose that capacity to deter attack or defend ourselves my profound conviction be that the american people will say as one man no matter what the exertion or sacrifice we shall maintain that necessary strength but we can make no much tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on military strength for if we do only this the future would hold nothing for the world but a age of terror and so our 2 task be to do the constructive work of build a genuine peace we must never become so preoccupy with our desire for military strength that we neglect that area of economic development trade diplomacy education idea and principle where the foundation of real peace must be lay ii the threat to our safety and to the hope of a peaceful world can be simply state it be communist imperialism this threat be not something imagine by critic of the soviet soviet spokesman from the begin have publicly and frequently declare their aim to expand their power one way or another throughout the world the threat have become increasingly serious as this expansionist aim have be reinforce by a advance industrial military and scientific establishment but what make the soviet threat unique in history be its all inclusiveness every human activity be press into service as a weapon of expansion trade economic development military power art science education the whole world of idea all be harness to this same chariot of expansion the soviet be in short wage total cold war the only answer to a regime that wage total cold war be to wage total peace this mean bring to bear every asset of our personal and national life upon the task of build the condition in which security and peace can grow iii among our asset let us first briefly glance at our military power military power serve the cause of security by make prohibitive the cost of any aggressive attack it serve the cause of peace by hold up a shield behind which the patient constructive work of peace can go on but it can serve neither cause if we make either of two mistake the one would be to overestimate our strength and thus neglect crucially important action in the period just ahead the other would be to underestimate our strength thereby we may be tempt to become irresolute in our foreign relation to dishearten our friend and to lose our national poise and perspective in approach the complex problem ahead any orderly balance sheet of military strength must be in two part the first be the position as of today the 2 be the position in the period ahead as of today our defensive shield comprehend a vast complex of grind sea and air unit superbly equip and strategically deploy around the world the much powerful deterrent to war in the world today lie in the retaliatory power of our strategic air command and the aircraft of our navy they present to any potential attacker who would unleash war upon the world the prospect of virtual annihilation of his own country even if we assume a surprise attack on our base with a mark reduction in our strike power our bomber would immediately be on their way in sufficient strength to accomplish this mission of retaliation every inform government know this it be no secret since the korean armistice the american people have spend billion in maintain and strengthen this overall defensive shield this be the position as of today now as to the period ahead every part of our military establishment must and will be equip to do its defensive job with the much modern weapon and method but it be particularly important to our plan that we make a candid estimate of the effect of long range ballistic missile on the present deterrent power i have describe at this moment the consensus of opinion be that we be probably somewhat behind the soviet in some area of long range ballistic missile development but it be my conviction base on close study of all relevant intelligence that if we make the necessary effort we will have the missile in the need quantity and in time to sustain and strengthen the deterrent power of our increasingly efficient bomber one encourage fact evidence this ability be the rate of progress we have achieve since we begin to concentrate on this missile the intermediate ballistic missile thor and jupiter have already be order into production the parallel progress in the intercontinental ballistic missile effort will be advance by our plan for acceleration the development of the submarine base polaris missile system have progress so good that its future procurement schedule be be move forward markedly when it be remember that our country have concentrate on the development of ballistic missile for only about a 3 as long as the soviet this achievement show a rate of progress that speak for itself only a brief time back we be spend at the rate of only about one million dollar a year on long range ballistic missile in we spend much than one billion dollar on the aria titan thor jupiter and polaris program alone but i repeat gratify though this rate of progress be we must still do much our real problem then be not our strength today it be rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow what i have just say apply to our strength as a single country but we be not alone i have return from the recent nato meet with renew conviction that because we be a part of a world wide community of free and peaceful nation our own security be immeasurably increase by contrast the soviet union have surround itself with captive and sullen nation like a crack in the crust of a uneasily sleep volcano the hungarian uprising reveal the depth and intensity of the patriotic long for liberty that still burn within this country the world think of us as a country which be strong but which will never start a war the world also think of us as a land which have never enslave anyone and which be animate by humane ideal this friendship base on common ideal be one of our great source of strength it cement into a cohesive security arrangement the aggregate of the spiritual military and economic strength of all that nation which with us be ally by treaty and agreement up to this point i have talk solely about our military strength to deter a possible future war i now want to talk about the strength we need to win a different kind of war one that have already be launch against us it be the massive economic offensive that have be mount by the communist imperialist against free nation the communist imperialist regime have for some time be largely frustrate in their attempt at expansion base directly on force as a result they have begin to concentrate heavily on economic penetration particularly of newly develop country as a preliminary to political domination this non military drive if underestimate can defeat the free world regardless of our military strength this danger be all the great precisely because many of us fail or refuse to recognize it thus some people may be tempt to finance our extra military effort by cut economic assistance but at the very time when the economic threat be assume menace proportion to fail to strengthen our own effort would be nothing little than reckless folly admittedly much of us do not anticipate the psychological impact upon the world of the launch of the first earth satellite let us not make the same kind of mistake in another field by fail to anticipate the much much serious impact of the soviet economic offensive as with our military potential our economic asset be much than equal to the task our independent farmer produce a abundance of food and fibre our free worker be versatile intelligent and hardworking our businessman be imaginative and resourceful the productivity the adaptability of the american economy be the solid foundation stone of our security structure we have just conclude another prosperous year our output be once much the great in the nation's history in the latter part of the year some decline in employment and output occur follow the exceptionally rapid expansion of recent year in a free economy reflect as it do the independent judgment of million of people growth typically move forward unevenly but the basic force of growth remain unimpaired there be solid ground for confidence that economic growth will be resume without a extend interruption moreover the federal government constantly alert to sign of weaken in any part of our economy always stand ready with its full power to take any appropriate far action to promote renew business expansion if our history teach us anything it be this lesson so far as the economic potential of our nation be concern the believer in the future of america have always be the realist i count myself as one of this company our long range problem then be not the stamen of our enormous engine of production our problem be to make sure that we use this vast economic force confidently and creatively not only in direct military defense effort but likewise in our foreign policy through such activity as mutual economic aid and foreign trade in much the same way we have tremendous potential resource on other non military front to help in counter the soviet threat education science research and not less the idea and principle by which we live and in all this case the task ahead be to bring this resource much sharply to bear upon the new task of security and peace in a swiftly change world iv there be many item in the administration's program of a kind frequently include in a state of the union message with which i be not deal today they be important to us and to our prosperity but i be reserve them for treatment in separate communication because of my purpose today of speak only about matter bear directly upon our security and peace i now place before you a outline of action design to focus our resource upon the two task of security and peace in this special category i list eight item require action they be not merely desirable they be imperative defense reorganization the first need be to assure ourselves that military organization facilitate rather than hinder the function of the military establishment in maintain the security of the nation since world war ii the purpose of achieve maximum organizational efficiency in a modern defense establishment have several time occasion action by the congress and by the executive the advent of revolutionary new device bring with them the problem of overall continental defense create new difficulty reminiscent of that attend the advent of the airplane half a century ago some of the important new weapon which technology have produce do not fit into any exist service pattern they cut across all service involve all service and transcend all service at every stage from development to operation in some instance they defy classification accord to branch of service unfortunately the uncertainty result from such a situation and the jurisdictional dispute attend upon it tend to bewilder and confuse the public and create the impression that service difference be damage the national interest let us proudly remember that the member of the arm force give their basic allegiance solely to the unite state of that fact all of us be certain but pride of service and mistake zeal in promote particular doctrine have much than once occasion the kind of difficulty of which i have just speak i be not attempt today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service rivalry but one thing be sure whatever they be america want them stop recently i have have under special study the never end problem of efficient organization complicate as it be by new weapon soon my conclusion will be finalize i shall promptly take such executive action as be necessary and in a separate message i shall present appropriate recommendation to the congress meanwhile without anticipate the detail form that a reorganization should take i can state its main line in term of objective a major purpose of military organization be to achieve real unity in the defense establishment in all the principal feature of military activity of all this one of the much important to our nation's security be strategic plan and control this work must be do under unify direction the defense structure must be one which as a whole can assume with top efficiency and without friction the defense of america the defense establishment must therefore plan for a good integration of its defensive resource particularly with respect to the new weapon now build and under development this obviously require full coordination in their development production and use good organization can help assure this coordination in recognition of the need for single control in some of our much advance development project the secretary of defense have already decide to concentrate into one organization all the anti missile and satellite technology undertake within the department of defense another requirement of military organization be a clear subordination of the military service to duly constitute civilian authority this control must be real not merely on the surface next there must be assurance that a excessive numb of compartment in organization will not create costly and confuse compartment in our scientific and industrial effort finally to end inter service dispute require clear organization and decisive central direction support by the unstinted cooperation of every individual in the defense establishment civilian and military accelerate defense effort the 2 major action item be the acceleration of the defense effort in particular area affect by the fast pace of scientific and technological advance some of the point at which improve and increase effort be much essential be this we must have sure warn in case of attack the improvement of warn equipment be become increasingly important as we approach the period when long range missile will come into use we must protect and disperse our strike force and increase their readiness for instant reaction this mean much base facility and standby crew we must maintain deterrent retaliatory power this mean among other thing step up long range missile program accelerate program for other effective missile system and for some year much advance aircraft we must maintain freedom of the sea this mean nuclear submarine and cruiser improve anti submarine weapon missile ship and the like we must maintain all necessary type of mobile force to deal with local conflict should there be need this mean far improvement in equipment mobility tactic and fire power through increase in pay and incentive we must maintain in the arm force the skill manpower modern military force require we must be forward look in our research and development to anticipate and achieve the unimagined weapon of the future with this and other improvement we intend to assure that our vigilance power and technical excellence keep abreast of any realistic threat we face mutual aid 3 we must continue to strengthen our mutual security effort much people now realize that our program of military aid and defense support be a integral part of our own defense effort if the foundation of the free world structure be progressively allow to crumble under the pressure of communist imperialism the entire house of freedom would be in danger of collapse as for the mutual economic assistance program the benefit to us be threefold first the country receive this aid become bulwark against communist encroachment as their military defense and economy be strengthen nation that be conscious of a steady improvement in their industry education health and standard of live be not apt to fall prey to the blandishment of communist imperialist 2 this country be help to reach the point where mutually profitable trade can expand between them and us 3 the mutual confidence that come from work together on constructive project create a atmosphere in which real understand and peace can flourish to help bring this multiple benefit our economic aid effort should be make much effective in proposal for future economic aid i be stress a great use of repayable loan through the development loan fund through fund generate by sale of surplus farm product and through the export import bank while some increase in government fund will be require it remain our objective to encourage shift to the use of private capital source as rapidly as possible one great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past have be not a rational argument against it on the merit but a catchword give away program the real fact be that no investment we make in our own security and peace can pay us great dividend than necessary amount of economic aid to friendly nation this be no give away let's stick to fact we cannot afford to have one of our much essential security program shoot down with a slogan mutual trade 4 both in our national interest and in the interest of world peace we must have a five year extension of the trade agreement act with broaden authority to negotiate world trade support a significant segment of american industry and agriculture it provide employment for four and one half million american worker it help supply our ever increase demand for raw material it provide the opportunity for american free enterprise to develop on a worldwide scale it strengthen our friend and increase their desire to be friend world trade help to lie the groundwork for peace by make all free nation of the world strong and much self reliant america be today the world's great trade nation if we use this great asset wisely to meet the expand demand of the world we shall not only provide future opportunity for our own business agriculture and labor but in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospect for a prosperous harmonious world as president mckinley say as long ago as isolation be no long possible or desirable the period of exclusiveness be past scientific cooperation with our ally 5 it be of the high importance that the congress enact the necessary legislation to enable us to exchange appropriate scientific and technical information with friendly country as part of our effort to achieve effective scientific cooperation it be wasteful in the extreme for friendly ally to consume talent and money in solve problem that their friend have already solve all because of artificial barrier to share we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from the brilliant talent and mind of scientist in friendly country the task ahead will be hard enough without handcuff of our own make the groundwork for this kind of cooperation have already be lay in discussion among nato country promptness in follow through with legislation will be the good possible evidence of american unity of purpose in cooperate with our friend education and research 6 in the area of education and research i recommend a balance program to improve our resource involve a investment of about a billion dollar over a four year period this involve new activity by the department of health education and welfare design principally to encourage improve teach quality and student opportunity in the interest of national security it also provide a five fold increase in sum available to the national science foundation for its special activity in stimulate and improve science education scrupulous attention have be pay to maintain local control of educational policy spur the maximum amount of local effort and to avoid undue stress on the physical science at the expense of other branch of learn in the field of research i be ask for substantial increase in basic research fund include a double of the fund available to the national science foundation for this purpose but federal action can do only a part of the job in both education and research redouble exertion will be necessary on the part of all american if we be to rise to the demand of our time this mean hard work on the part of state and local government private industry school and college private organization and foundation teacher parent and perhaps much important of all the student himself with his bag of book and his homework with this kind of all inclusive campaign i have no doubt that we can create the intellectual capital we need for the year ahead invest it in the right place and do all this not as regiment pawn but as free man and woman spend and save 7 to provide for this extra effort for security we must apply stern test of priority to other expenditure both military and civilian this extra effort involve much immediately the need for a supplemental defense appropriation of billion for fiscal year in the budget increase expenditure for missile nuclear ship atomic energy research and development science and education a special contingency fund to deal with possible new technological discovery and increase in pay and incentive to obtain and retain competent manpower add up to a total increase over the comparable figure in the budget of about billion i believe that in spite of this necessary increase we should strive to finance the security effort out of expect revenue while we now believe that expect revenue and expenditure will roughly balance our real purpose will be to achieve adequate security but always with the utmost regard for efficiency and careful management this purpose will require the cooperation of congress in make careful analysis of estimate present reduce expenditure on little essential military program and installation postpone some new civilian program transfer some to the state and curtail or eliminate other such relate matter as the national debt ceil and tax revenue will be deal with in late message work of peace my last call for action be not primarily address to the congress and people of the unite state rather it be a message from the people of the unite state to all other people especially that of the soviet union this be the spirit of what we would like to say in the last analysis there be only one solution to the grim problem that lie ahead the world must stop the present plunge toward much and much destructive weapon of war and turn the corner that will start our step firmly on the path toward last peace our great hope for success lie in a universal fact the people of the world as people have always want peace and want peace now the problem then be to find a way of translate this universal desire into action this will require much than word of peace it require work of peace now may i try to give you some concrete example of the kind of work of peace that may make a begin in the new direction for a start our people should learn to know each other good recent negotiation in washington have provide a basis in principle for great freedom of communication and exchange of people i urge the soviet government to cooperate in turn principle into practice by prompt and tangible action that will break down the unnatural barrier that have block the flow of think and understand between our people another kind of work of peace be cooperation on project of human welfare for example we now have it within our power to eradicate from the face of the earth that age old scourge of mankind malaria we be embark with other nation in a all out five year campaign to blot out this curse forever we invite the soviet to join with us in this great work of humanity indeed we would be will to pool our effort with the soviet in other campaign against the disease that be the common enemy of all mortal such as cancer and heart disease if people can get together on such project be it not possible that we can then go on to a full scale cooperative program of science for peace we have as a guide and inspiration the success of our atom for peace proposal which in only a few year under unite nation auspice become a reality in the international atomic energy agency a program of science for peace may provide a mean of funnel into one place the result of research from scientist everywhere and from there make it available to all part of the world there be almost no limit to the human betterment that can result from such cooperation hunger and disease can increasingly be drive from the earth the age old dream of a good life for all can at long last be translate into reality but of all the work of peace none be much need now than a real first step toward disarmament last august the unite nation general assembly by a overwhelm vote approve a disarmament plan that we and our ally sincerely believe to be fair and practical the soviet have reject both the plan and the negotiate procedure set up by the unite nation as a result negotiation on this supremely important issue be now at a stand still but the world cannot afford to stand still on disarmament we must never give up the search for a basis of agreement our ally from time to time develop differ idea on how to proceed we must concert this conviction among ourselves thereafter any reasonable proposal that hold promise for disarmament and reduction of tension must be hear discuss and if possible negotiate but a disarmament proposal to hold real promise must at the minimum have one feature reliable mean to ensure compliance by all it take action and demonstrate integrity on both side to create and sustain confidence and confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement be vital not only to the signer of the agreement but also to the million of people all over the world who be weary of tension and armament i say once much to all people that we will always go the extra mile with anyone on earth if it will bring us near a genuine peace conclusion this then be the way in which we must funnel our energy much efficiently into the task of advance security and peace this action demand and expect two thing of the american people sacrifice and a high degree of understand for sacrifice to be effective it must be intelligent sacrifice must be make for the right purpose and in the right place even if that place happen to come close to home after all it be no good demand sacrifice in general term one day and the next day for local reason oppose the elimination of some unneeded federal facility it be pointless to condemn federal spend in general and the next moment condemn just as strongly a effort to reduce the particular federal grant that touch one's own interest and it make no sense whatever to spend additional billion on military strength to deter a potential danger and then by cut aid and trade program let the world succumb to a present danger in economic guise my friend of the congress the world be wait to see how wisely and decisively a free representative government will now act i believe that this congress possess and will display the wisdom promptly to do its part in translate into law the action demand by our nation's interest but to make law effective our kind of government need the full voluntary support of million of american for this action i be fully confident that the response of the congress and of the american people will make this time of test a time of honor mankind then will see much clearly than ever that the future belong not to the concept of the regiment atheistic state but to the people the god fear peace love people of all the world mr president mr speaker member of the 86th congress my fellow citizen this be the moment when congress and the executive annually begin their cooperative work to build a good america one basic purpose unite us to promote strength and security side by side with liberty and opportunity as we meet today in the 170th year of the republic our nation must continue to provide as all other free government have have to do throughout time a satisfactory answer to a question as old as history it be can government base upon liberty and the god give right of man permanently endure when ceaselessly challenge by a dictatorship hostile to our mode of life and control a economic and military power of great and grow strength for us the answer have always be find and be still find in the devotion the vision the courage and the fortitude of our people moreover this challenge we face not as a single powerful nation but as one that have in recent decade reach a position of recognize leadership in the free world we have arrive at this position of leadership in a era of remarkable productivity and growth it be also a time when man's power of mass destruction have reach fearful proportion possession of such capability help create world suspicion and tension we on our part know that we seek only a just peace for all with aggressive design against no one yet we realize that there be uneasiness in the world because of a belief on the part of people that through arrogance miscalculation or fear of attack catastrophic war can be launch keep the peace in today's world much than ever call for the utmost in the nation's resolution wisdom steadiness and unremitting effort we cannot build peace through desire alone moreover we have learn the bitter lesson that international agreement historically consider by us as sacred be regard in communist doctrine and in practice to be mere scrap of paper the much recent proof of their disdain of international obligation solemnly undertake be their announce intention to abandon their responsibility respect berlin as a consequence we can have no confidence in any treaty to which communist be a party except where such a treaty provide within itself for self enforce mechanism indeed the demonstrate disregard of the communist of their own pledge be one of the great obstacle to success in substitute the rule of law for rule by force yet step by step we must strengthen the institution of peace a peace that rest upon justice a peace that depend upon a deep knowledge and dear understand by all people of the cause and consequence of possible failure in this great purpose to achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any dimension if despite our good effort a local dispute should flare into arm hostility the next problem would be to keep the conflict from spread and so compromise freedom in support of this objective we maintain force of great power and flexibility our formidable air strike force be a powerful deterrent to general war large and grow portion of this unit can depart from their base in a matter of minute similar force be include in our naval fleet grind and other tactical formation can move with swiftness and precision when request by friendly and responsible government to help curb threaten aggression the stabilize influence of this capacity have be dramatically demonstrate much than once over the past year our military and relate scientific progress have be highly gratify great stride have be make in the development of ballistic missile intermediate range missile be now be deploy in operational unit the aria intercontinental ballistic missile program have be mark by rapid development as evidence by recent successful test missile train unit have be establish and launch site be far along in construction new aircraft that fly at twice the speed of sound be enter our squadron we have successfully place five satellite in orbit which have gather information of scientific importance never before available our late satellite illustrate our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadow new development in world wide communication warn system constantly improve our atomic submarine have shatter endurance record and make historic voyage under the north polar sea a major segment of our national scientific and engineer community be work intensively to achieve new and great development advance in military technology require adequate finance but of course even much it require talent and time all this be give only as a matter of history as a record of our progress in space and ballistic missile field in no much than four year of intensive effort at the same time we clearly recognize that some of the recent soviet accomplishment in this particular technology be indeed brilliant under the law enact last year the department of defense be be reorganize to give the secretary of defense full authority over the military establishment great efficiency much cohesive effort and speedy reaction to emergency be among the many advantage we be already note from this change this few highlight point up our steady military gain we be rightfully gratify by the achievement they represent but we must remember that this impose armament be purchase at great cost national security program account for nearly sixty percent of the entire federal budget for this come fiscal year modern weapon be exceedingly expensive the overall cost of introduce atla into our arm force will average million per missile on the fire line this year we be invest a aggregate of close to billion in missile program alone other billion go for research development test and evaluation of new weapon system our late atomic submarine will cost million each while some special type will cost three time as much we be now order fighter aircraft which be price at fifty time as much as the fighter of world war ii we be buy certain bomber that cost their weight in gold this sum be tremendous even when compare with the marvelous resiliency and capacity of our economy such expenditure demand both balance and perspective in our plan for defense at every turn we must weigh judge and select needless duplication of weapon and force must be avoid we must guard against feverish build of vast armament to meet glibly predict moment of so call maximum peril the threat we face be not sporadic or date it be continuous hence we must not be sway in our calculation either by groundless fear or by complacency we must avoid extreme for vacillation between extreme be inefficient costly and destructive of morale in this day of unceasing technological advance we must plan our defense expenditure systematically and with care fully recognize that obsolescence compel the never end replacement of old weapon with new one the defense budget for the come year have be plan on the basis of this principle and consideration over this many month i have personally participate in its development the aim be a sensible posture of defense the secondary aim be increase efficiency and avoidance of waste both be achieve by this budgetary plan work by this guide line i believe with all my heart that america can be as sure of the strength and efficiency of her arm force as she be of their loyalty i be equally sure that the nation will thus avoid useless expenditure which in the name of security may tend to undermine the economy and therefore the nation's safety our own vast strength be only a part of that require for dependable security because of this we have join with nearly other nation in collective security arrangement in this common undertaking each nation be expect to contribute what it can in share the heavy load each supply part of a strategic deployment to protect the forward boundary of freedom constantly we seek new way to make much effective our contribution to this system of collective security recently i have ask a committee of eminent american of both party to re appraise our military assistance program and the relative emphasis which should be place on military and economic aid i be hopeful that preliminary recommendation of this committee will be available in time to assist in shape the mutual security program for the come fiscal year any survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a feel of regret that so much of our effort and resource must be devote to armament at geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and other agreement that may help to open up with some promise the issue of international disarmament america will never give up the hope that eventually all nation can with mutual confidence drastically reduce this non productive expenditure ii the material foundation of our national safety be a strong and expand economy this we have and this we must maintain only with such a economy can we be secure and simultaneously provide for the good be of our people a year ago the nation be experience a decline in employment and output today that recession be fade into history and this without gigantic hastily improvise public work project or untimely tax reduction a healthy and vigorous recovery have be under way since last may new home be be build at the high rate in several year retail sale be at peak level personal income be at a all time high the mark forward thrust of our economy reaffirm our confidence in competitive enterprise but clearly wisdom and prudence in both the public and private sector of the economy be always necessary our outlook be this commitment for our arm force the atomic energy commission and military assistance exceed billion dollar in the foreseeable future they be not likely to be significantly low with a annual population increase of three million other governmental cost be bind to mount after we have provide wisely for our military strength we must judge how to allocate our remain government resource much effectively to promote our good be and economic growth federal program that will benefit all citizen be move forward next year we will be spend increase amount on health program on federal assistance to science and education on the development of the nation's water resource on the renewal of urban area and on our vast system of federal aid highway each of this additional outlay be be make necessary by the surge growth of america let me illustrate responsive to this growth federal grant and long term loan to assist major type of capital improvement in our city will total over billion dollar in double the expenditure of two year ago the major responsibility for development in this field rest in the locality even though the federal government will continue to do its proper part in meet the genuine need of a burgeon population but the progress of our economy can much than match the growth of our need we need only to act wisely and confidently here i hope you will permit me to digress long enough to express something that be much on my mind the basic question face us today be much than mere survival the military defense of national life and territory it be the preservation of a way of life we must meet the world challenge and at the same time permit no stagnation in america unless we progress we regress we can successfully sustain security and remain true to our heritage of freedom if we clearly visualize the task ahead and set out to perform them with resolution and fervor we must first define this task and then understand what we must do to perform them if progress be to be steady we must have long term guide extend far ahead certainly five possibly even ten year they must reflect the knowledge that before the end of five year we will have a population of over million they must be goal that stand high and so inspire every citizen to climb always toward mount level of moral intellectual and material strength every advance toward them must stir pride in individual and national achievement to define this goal i intend to mobilize help from every available source we need much than politically ordain national objective to challenge the good effort of free man and woman a group of selfless and devote individual outside of government can effectively participate in make the necessary appraisal of the potential of our future the result would be establishment of national goal that would not only spur us on to our fine effort but would meet the stern test of practicality the committee i plan will comprise educator and representative of labor management finance the profession and every other kind of useful activity such a study would update and supplement in the light of continuous change in our society and its economy the monumental work of the committee on recent social trend which be appoint in by president hoover its report have stand the test of time and have have a beneficial influence on national development the new committee would be concern among other thing with the acceleration of our economy's growth and the live standard of our people their health and education their good assurance of life and liberty and their great opportunity it would also be concern with method to meet such goal and what level of government local state or federal may or should be particularly concern as one example consider our school operate under the authority of local community and state in their capacity and in their quality they conform to no recognizable standard in some place facility be ample in other meager pay of teacher range between wide limit from the adequate to the shameful as would be expect quality of teach vary just as widely but to our teacher we commit the much valuable possession of the nation and of the family our child we must have teacher of competence to obtain and hold them we need standard we need a national goal once establish i be certain that public opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment such study would be helpful i believe to government at all level and to all individual the goal so establish can help us see our current need in perspective they will spur progress we do not forget of course that our nation's progress and fiscal integrity be interdependent and inseparable we can afford everything we clearly need but we cannot afford one cent of waste we must examine every item of governmental expense critically to do otherwise would betray our nation's future thrift be one of the characteristic that have make this nation great why should we ignore it now we must avoid any contribution to inflationary process which can disrupt sound growth in our economy price have display a welcome stability in recent month and if we be wise and resolute we will not tolerate inflation in the year to come but history make clear the risk inherent in any failure to deal firmly with the basic cause of inflation two of the much important of this cause be the wage price spiral and continue deficit finance inflation would reduce job opportunity price us out of world market shrink the value of saving and penalize the thrift so essential to finance a grow economy inflation be not a robin hood take from the rich to give to the poor rather it deal much cruelly with that who can less protect themselves it strike hard that million of our citizen whose income do not quickly rise with the cost of live when price soar the pensioner and the widow see their security undermine the man of thrift see his saving melt away the white collar worker the minister and the teacher see their standard of live drag down inflation can be prevent but this demand statesmanship on the part of business and labor leader and of government at all level we must encourage the self discipline the restraint necessary to curb the wage price spiral and we must meet current cost from current revenue to minimize the danger of future soar price and to keep our economy sound and expand i shall present to the congress certain proposal first i shall submit a balance budget for the next year a year expect to be the much prosperous in our history it be a realistic budget with wholly attainable objective if we cannot live within our mean during such a time of rise prosperity the hope for fiscal integrity will fade if we persist in live beyond our mean we make it difficult for every family in our land to balance its own household budget but to live within our mean would be a tangible demonstration of the self discipline need to assure a stable dollar the constitution entrust the executive with many function but the congress and the congress alone have the power of the purse ultimately upon congress rest responsibility for determine the scope and amount of federal spend by work together the congress and the executive can keep a balance between income and outgo if this be do there be real hope that we can look forward to a time in the foreseeable future when need tax reform can be accomplish in this hope i be request the secretary of the treasury to prepare appropriate proposal for revise at the proper time our tax structure to remove inequity and to enhance incentive for all american to work to save and to invest such recommendation will be make as soon as our fiscal condition permit this prospect will be brighten if expenditure do not exceed the level recommend 2 i shall recommend to the congress that the chief executive be give the responsibility either to approve or to veto specific item in appropriation and authorization bill this would save tax dollar 1at this point the message as record from the floor and print in the congressional record show the follow interpolation i assure you gentleman that i know this recommendation have be make time and again by every president that have appear in this hall for many year but i say this it still be one of the much important correction that can be make in our annual expenditure program because this would save tax dollar 3 to reduce federal operation in a area where private enterprise can do the job i shall recommend legislation for great flexibility in extend federal credit and in improve the procedure under which private credit be insure or guarantee present practice have needlessly add large sum to federal expenditure 4 action be require to make much effective use of the large federal expenditure for agriculture and to achieve great fiscal control in this area outlay of the department of agriculture for the current fiscal year for the support of farm price on a very few farm product will exceed five billion dollar that be a sum equal to approximately two fifth of the net income of all farm operator in the entire unite state by the end of this fiscal year it be estimate that there will be in government hand surplus farm product worth about nine billion dollar and by july government expenditure for storage interest and handle of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion dollar a year this level of expenditure for farm product can be make willingly for a temporary period if it be lead to a sound solution of the problem but unfortunately this be not true we need new legislation in the past i have send message to the congress request great freedom for our farmer to manage their own farm and great freedom for market to reflect the wish of producer and consumer legislative change that follow be appropriate in direction but do not go far enough the situation call for prompt and forthright action recommendation for action will be contain in a message to be transmit to the congress shortly this fiscal and relate action will help create a environment of price stability for economic growth however certain additional measure be need i shall ask congress to amend the employment act of to make it clear that government intend to use all appropriate mean to protect the buy power of the dollar i be establish a continue cabinet group on price stability for economic growth to study governmental and private policy affect cost price and economic growth it will strive also to build a good public understand of the condition necessary for maintain growth and price stability study be be undertake to improve our information on price wage and productivity i believe all citizen in all walk of life will support this program of action to accelerate economic growth and promote price stability iii i take up next certain aspect of our international situation and our program to strengthen it america's security can be assure only within a world community strong stable independent nation in which the concept of freedom justice and human dignity can flourish there can be no such thing as fortress america if ever we be reduce to the isolation imply by that term we would occupy a prison not a fortress the question whether we can afford to help other nation that want to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own mean have only one answer we can and we must we have be do so since our foreign policy have long be dedicate to build a permanent and just peace during the past six year our free world security arrangement have be bolster and the bond of freedom have be much closely knit our friend in western europe be experience new internal vitality and be increasingly much able to resist external threat over the year the world have come to understand clearly that it be our firm policy not to countenance aggression in lebanon taiwan and berlin our stand have be dear right and expressive of the determine will of a unite people act with other free nation we have undertake the solemn obligation to defend the people of free berlin against any effort to destroy their freedom in the meantime we shall constantly seek meaningful agreement to settle this and other problem know full good that not only the integrity of a single city but the hope of all free people be at stake we need likewise to continue help to build the economic base so essential to the free world's stability and strength the international monetary fund and the world bank have both fully prove their worth as instrument of international financial cooperation their executive director have recommend a increase in each member country's subscription i be request the congress for immediate approval of our share of this increase we be now negotiate with representative of the twenty latin american republic for the creation of a inter american financial institution its purpose would be to join all the american republic in a common institution which would promote and finance development in latin america and make much effective the use of capital from the world bank the export import bank and private source private enterprise continue to make major contribution to economic development in all part of the world but we have not yet marshal the full potential of american business for this task particularly in country which have recently attain their independence i shall present to this congress a program design to encourage great participation by private enterprise in economic development abroad far all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do much much than help build sound economy the spiritual intellectual and physical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis determine their willingness and their ability to resist communism to give a single illustration of our many effort in this field we have be a participant in the effort that have be make over the past few year against one of the great scourge of mankind disease through the mutual security program public health official be be train by american university to serve in little develop country we be engage in intensive malaria eradication project in many part of the world america's major success in our own country prove the feasibility of success everywhere by this and other mean we shall continue and expand our campaign against the affliction that now bring needless suffer and death to so many of the world's people we wish to be part of a great share effort toward the triumph of health iv america be good describe by one word freedom if we hope to strengthen freedom in the world we must be ever mindful of how our own conduct react elsewhere no nation have ever be so floodlight by world opinion as the unite state be today everything we do be carefully scrutinize by other people throughout the world the bad be see along with the good because we be human we err but as free man we be also responsible for correct the error and imperfection of our way last january i make comprehensive recommendation to the congress for legislation in the labor management field to my disappointment congress fail to act the mcclellan committee disclosure of corruption racketeering and abuse of trust and power in labor management affair have arouse america and amaze other people they emphasize the need for improve local law enforcement and the enactment
