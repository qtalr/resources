  In this recipe, I cover the tools and strategies for sharing research findings with the public and peers. We will begin assuming we are using Quarto websites as the primary tool for sharing research findings in both forums. From there, we will enter into some of the details of articles, presentations, and publishing research code and data.

## Concepts and strategies

### Public facing communication

R (or Python) research projects that take advantage of Quarto websites have access to a wide range of tools for sharing research. First, the entire research tool chain can be published as a website, which is a great way to share the research process. Second, the website can be used to share the research findings in particular formats including articles and presentations. Let's focus in on these later formats and discuss strategies for setting up and formatting research articles and presentations.

We will assume the project directory structure in @lst-quarto-website.

::: {#lst-quarto-website}

Quarto website structure for reproducible research
:::

I will also assume the following Quarto configuration file *\_quarto.yml* in @lst-quarto-config.

::: {#lst-quarto-config}
```yaml
project:
  title: "Web project"
  type: website
  execute-dir: project              # <1>
  render:                           # <2>
    - index.qmd
    - process/1_acquire.qmd
    - process/2_curate.qmd
    - process/3_transform.qmd
    - process/4_analyze.qmd
    - reports/

website:
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"                 # <3>
    contents:                       # <4>
      - index.qmd
      - section: "Process"
        contents: process/*         # <5>
      - section: "Reports"
        contents: reports/*         # <6>

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true

execute:
  freeze: auto                      # <7>
```
1. **Execution directory**: The root directory for all execution.
2. **Render order**: The order in which files are rendered.
3. **Sidebar style**: The style of the sidebar.
4. **Sidebar contents**: The contents of the sidebar.
5. **Process contents**: The contents of the process section.
6. **Reports contents**: The contents of the reports section.
7. **Freeze option**: The option for rendering only changed files.

Quarto configuration file for reproducible research
:::

Looking more closely at the directory structure in @lst-quarto-website, let's focus on the aspects that are shared between articles and presentations. You will notice that the *reports/* directory contains a *figures/* directory for saving figures, a *tables/* directory for saving tables, and a *references.bib* file for saving references. These are shared resources that can be used in both articles and presentations. In the process directory, you can save tables, figures, and other resources that are generated during the research process that you believe will be useful in commmunicating the research findings. Then, when you create your presentations, you can include the same materials in either format with the same files. If changes are made to the figures or tables, they will be updated in both the article and the presentation(s).

Next, it is worth pointing out some important features that appear in the @lst-quarto-config configuration file. The `execute-dir` specifies the root directory for all execution. That is the path to directories and files will be the same no matter from what file the code is executed. The `render` option specifies the order in which the files are rendered. This is important for ensuring that the research process is executed in the correct order. The files that are executed and rendered for display appear in the website and the `style` and `contents` options specify the style and contents of the sidebar, respectively. Another key option is the `freeze` option under `execute`. This option specifies that only changed files will be rendered. This helps avoid re-rendering files that have not changed, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.

#### Articles

In the *reports/* directory a file named *article.qmd* appears. This file, which can be named anything, will be the document in which we will draft the research article. This file is a standard Quarto document. However, we can take advantage of some options that we have not seen so far that adds functionality to the document.

In @lst-quarto-article, we see an example of the YAML frontmatter for a Quarto article.

::: {#lst-quarto-article}
```yaml
title: "Article"
date: 2024-02-20
author:                               # <1>
  - name: "Your name"
    email: youremail@school.edu
    affiliation: "Your affiliation"
abstract: |                           # <2>
  This is a sample article. It is a work in progress and will be updated as the research progresses.
keywords:                             # <3>
  - article
  - example
csl: citation-style.csl               # <4>
bibliography: ../bibliography.bib     # <5>
citation: true                        # <6>
format:                               # <7>
  html: default                       # <8>
  pdf:                                # <9>
    number-sections: true
```
1. **Author information**: The author information for the article.
2. **Abstract**: The abstract for the article.
3. **Keywords**: The keywords for the article.
4. **Citation style**: The citation style for the article.
5. **Bibliography**: The bibliography for the article.
6. **Citation**: The citation for the article itself.
7. **Format**: The format for the article.
8. **HTML format**: The HTML format for the article (for web presentation)
9. **PDF format**: The PDF format for the article (for printing)

Quarto article YAML frontmatter
:::

In addition to typical YAML frontmatter, we see a number of new times. Looking at the first three, we see that we can add author information, an abstract, and keywords. These are standard for articles and are used to provide information about the article to readers.

When rendered, the article header information will now contain this new information, as seen in @fig-header-format.

::: {#fig-header-format}

[![](images/header-format.png)]{alt-text="Header format for Quarto article"}

Appearance of the header format for a Quarto article.
:::

The next two items are the citation style and bibliography. These are used to create and format citations in the article. The citation style is a CSL file that specifies the citation style. You can find a database of various citation styles at the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You can search for a style or by field. Once you find a style you like, you can download the CSL file and add it to your project. The bibliography is a BibTeX file that contains the references for the article. You can create this file (as mentioned before) in a reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley.

Now the `citation` option is not for references that we have gathered. Rather, it is for generating a citation for the current article. This is useful if someone else would like to cite your article. When the article is rendered, the citation will appear at the bottom of the article, as seen in @fig-citation-attribution.

::: {#fig-citation-attribution}

[![](images/citation-attribution.png)]{alt-text="Citation attribution in Quarto article"}

Appearance of the citation attribution in a Quarto article.
:::

There are two other features to mention. One is the `format` option. Since the article is a Quarto document, it can be rendered in multiple formats. The `html` option ensures that our article is rendered in HTML format as part of the website. However, in addition, we can add a `pdf` option that will render the article in PDF format. Note that in @fig-header-format, the `pdf` option has created an "Other formats" listing on the right side below the table of contents. Clicking this will open the PDF version of the article.

Although not employed in this example, it is also possible to use more extensive format changes with [Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html). Currently, there are various extensions for different journals and publishing houses. For more information and examples, consult the documentation above.

#### Presentations

In the *reports/* directory we can also include presentations and associated slide decks. A popular web-based presentation framework is [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). This framework is used in Quarto to create presentations. In @lst-quarto-website, the *slides/* directory contains a directory for each presentation and an *index.qmd* file within. The *index.qmd* file contains the presentation content, which we will see soon. To provide a listings page each presentation, the *presentations.qmd* file contains special YAML instructions to be a listings page.

Let's first dive into the *index.qmd* file for a presentation and discuss some of the key features. In @lst-quarto-presentation, we see a basic example of a Quarto presentation.

::: {#lst-quarto-presentation}

```yaml
title: "Examle presentation"
date: 2024-02-20
author: "Jerid Francom"
format: revealjs
```

Quarto presentation YAML frontmatter *index.qmd*
:::

The YAML frontmatter for a Quarto presentation is similar to that of most Quarto documents. The title, date, and author are all included. The `format` option specifies that the presentation will be rendered in `reveal.js` format. When rendered, the presentation the slide deck will be interactive and can be navigated by the user. The slide deck will also be responsive and can be viewed on any device.

In @fig-revealjs-example, we see an example of a Quarto presentation rendered in `reveal.js` format. I will discuss some of the key features of the presentation, in the presentation itself.

::: {#fig-revealjs-example}
```{=html}
<style>
.slide-deck {
  width: 90%;
  height: 400px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
</style>
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="presentation/"></iframe>

Demonstration of running a collaborative research project on GitHub following reproducible research principles

We will also discuss some of the strategies for sharing research code and data, including:

- Version control (GitHub)
- Reproducible research (Quarto, `renv`, Docker)

Walkthrough of a complete reproducible research project setup, including documentation, modular scripts, and containerization with GitHub Actions.

-->

For those who are interested in interacting with your work, it is key to prepare materials that can be reliably shared. This includes the research code and data, of course, but also the computational environment in which the research was conducted so that the research can be reproduced.

::: {#fig-computational-environment}

![](./images/nested-project.drawio.png)

Computational environment for reproducible research

:::


In the next section, we will discuss some of the strategies for sharing a reproducible computational environment, along with code and data. This will include version control with Git, pinned package versions with {renv}, containerization with Docker, and automation with GitHub Actions.

#### Tools and strategies

As seen in @fig-computational-environment, the computational environment for a research project includes various components. Let's start with the inner components are work our way out.

**Version control**

As has been stressed throughout this text, version control is a key part of reproducible research. It allows you to track changes to your research code and data over time, the research compendium. This is important for ensuring that the research record is transparent. One of the most popular version control systems is Git. If you have interacted with the supplementary materials provided with this text (lessons, recipes, and labs), you are now familiar with working with Git (and GitHub) in day-to-day tasks. These tasks include:

- Cloning a repository
- Making changes to a repository
- Committing changes to a repository
- Pushing changes to a repository
- Pulling changes from a repository
- Forking a repository

These tasks are essential for collaborating with others on research projects and contributing to open source projects. However, there are a few other tasks which will prove useful if you continue on in your reproducible research journey. In Git, these include:

- **Branching** \
This allows you to work on different versions of your research project at the same time. For example, you could have a `main` branch for the current version of your research project and a `develop` branch for the next version of your research project.
- **Merging** \
This allows you to combine changes from one branch into another branch. For example, you could merge changes from the `develop` branch into the `main` branch once they are complete.
- **Pull requests** \
This allows you to propose changes to a repository and discuss them with others before merging them. For example, you could create a pull request to propose changes to the `main` branch from the `develop` branch.

We will not cover these in detail here, but it is good to be aware of them if you plan on collaborating on git-maintained projects. For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en).

**Pinned package versions**

Moving out a level, we have the software layer. This includes the R packages that you use in your project, the version of R that you use, and the system dependencies that are required. Sharing your research project code does not guarantee that others will be able to reproduce it --R packages versions are constantly being updated and this can lead to 'breaking changes' that render your code inoperable. R itself changes over time, although less frequent when compared to packages.

To ensure that your research is reproducible, it is important to share the software layer as well. This can be done with the {renv} package. {renv} allows you to create a snapshot of the version of R and the R packages that you use in your research project. This snapshot can then be shared with others, ensuring that they have the same R and R package versions that you use.

To set up an R project with {renv}, you need to initialize the project. In the R console, run `renv::init()`. Let's assume we start with the project structure in @lst-quarto-website, after initializing {renv}, a `renv/` directory and a `renv.lock` file are added, as seen in @lst-renv-init.


::: {#lst-renv-init}
```bash
project/
  ├── data/
  ├── process/
  ├── reports/
  ├── renv/                  # <1>
  │  ├── activate.R          # <2>
  │  ├── library/            # <3>
  │  └── settings.json       # <4>
  ├── _quarto.yml
  ├── index.qmd
  ├── README.md
  └── renv.lock              # <5>
```
1. **renv directory**: The directory for the {renv} package
2. **activate.R file**: The file for the {renv} activation script
3. **library directory**: The directory for the {renv} library
4. **settings.json file**: The file for the {renv} settings
5. **renv.lock file**: The file for the {renv} lock file
:::


On initalization, {renv} will create a `renv.lock` file that contains a registry of the versions of the R packages that you are using. This file can be shared with others, ensuring that they install the same versions of the R packages that you used in your research project. The `renv/` directory contains a `activate.R` file is a script that activates the {renv} package when you open the project in RStudio, a `library/` directory contains a local library, that is, the R packages that you are using in your research project, and finally a `settings.json` file contains the settings for the {renv} package.

Behind the scenes, {renv} also adds a `.gitignore` file within the `renv/` directory which ensures you do not accidentally commit the R packages to your repository (found in the `renv/library/` directory). This is important because the R packages can be large and take up a lot of space in your repository. The `renv.lock` file alone can be used to restore the R packages with the correct versions by running `renv::restore()` function.

::: {.callout}
**{{< fa regular hand-point-up >}} Tip**

If you start a project with {renv}, you will need to make sure that your local library and `renv.lock` reflect the packages you install moving forward. To check the status of your project, you can run `renv::status()`. This will show you the packages that are installed in your local library and the packages that are in the `renv.lock` file. If there are differences, you can run `renv::snapshot()` to update the `renv.lock` file.
:::

**Containerization**

Now, we are nearing the outer layer of the computational environment. But before we get there, we need to discuss containerization, a strategy that will help us share operating system and system software dependencies, straddling two layers of the computational environment illustrated in @fig-computational-environment.

Containerization allows you to create a self-contained environment for your research code and data. This effectively means that you and your collaborators can use the same operating system and system dependencies. The container runs an operating system which is isolated from the host operating system. This has two main benefits: one, users do not need to change their host systems to run your project and two, the operating system and system dependencies are the same for everyone, ensuring that the research is reproducible.

One popular containerization tool is Docker. Docker allows you to create a Docker image that contains the operating system and system dependencies for your research project from a blueprint file called a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions to create the Docker image. For example, we can create a very simple Dockerfile that will generate an image with R installed, as seen in @lst-base-dockerfile.

::: {#lst-base-dockerfile}
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

# Base image with R
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.1.1            # <1>
```
1. **Base image**: The base image for the Dockerfile
:::

In this Dockerfile we use the `rocker/r-ver:4.1.1` image as the base image. That is to say that Dockerfiles can import and extend other images that have been built from other Dockerfiles. The [Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org/) creates and maintains a number of very useful images for R users to use and extend. In this case, we are using the `r-ver` image which contains R version 4.1.1. There are `r-ver` for many other R versions, even one for the latest R version, whatever that may be.

::: {.callout}
**{{< fa medal >}} Dive deeper**

Visit the Rocker Project's [image list](https://rocker-project.org/images/) to explore the available images.
:::

Another thing to note about images from the Rocker Project (and many other Docker images) is that the operating system will be based on some version of Linux. Linux is a popular choice for Docker images because it is lightweight and can be easily extended. These are good attributes, but even more importantly, Linux is freely available and open sources, this means that the images can be shared without licensing issues.

An OS is not the only aspect that a Dockerfile can address that will help us to create a publishable reproducible research project. In addition, we can add system dependencies, modify the system in various ways, add files to the image, and set up the environment for running the project.

So if we assume the project structure in @lst-quarto-website, we can add a Dockerfile to the project as seen in @lst-dockerfile.

::: {#lst-dockerfile}
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

# Base image with R
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.1.1                        # <1>

ENV DEFAULT_USER="ruser"

# User rocker scripts to set up
# pandoc, quarto, and default user
RUN /rocker_scripts/install_pandoc.sh
RUN /rocker_scripts/install_quarto.sh
RUN /rocker_scripts/default_user.sh $DEFAULT_USER

RUN usermod -aG sudo ${DEFAULT_USER} && \
    echo '%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers

USER $DEFAULT_USER

# Copy project file
COPY . /home/ruser/project

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /home/ruser/project

RUN R -q -e "install.packages(c('pak', 'renv'), repos = c('https://cloud.r-project.org/', 'https://r-lib.r-universe.dev'));"

# Set bash entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```
:::


The `pak` package provides a way to determine the dependencies for a package or set of packages on a given operating system (platform).

::: {.callout}
**{{< fa medal >}} Dive deeper**

When creating a reproducible computing environment, it will be necessary to include system dependencies to ensure that the project is reproducible. The `pak` package provides a way to determine the dependencies for a package or set of packages on a given operating system (platform).

```r
pak::pkg_sysreqs(pkg = c("knitr", "systemfonts"), sysreqs = "ubuntu")
```

```xml
── Install scripts ──── Ubuntu NA
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install pandoc libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev

── Packages and their system dependencies
knitr       – pandoc
systemfonts – libfontconfig1-dev, libfreetype6-dev
```

These can be added to the Dockerfile for the project
:::


In GitHub, these include:

- Using issues to track and respond to inquiries
- GitHub Actions for automating tasks
- GitHub Pages for hosting websites

We will have more to say about these tools and strategies later in this recipe.
