  In this recipe, I cover the tools and strategies for sharing research findings with the public and peers. We will begin assuming we are using Quarto websites as the primary tool for sharing research findings in both forums. From there, we will enter into some of the details of articles, presentations, and publishing research code and data.

## Concepts and strategies

### Public facing communication

R (or Python) research projects that take advantage of Quarto websites have access to a wide range of tools for sharing research. First, the entire research tool chain can be published as a website, which is a great way to share the research process. Second, the website can be used to share the research findings in particular formats including articles and presentations. Let's focus in on these later formats and discuss strategies for setting up and formatting research articles and presentations.

We will assume the project directory structure in @lst-quarto-website.

::: {#lst-quarto-website}

Quarto website structure for reproducible research
:::

I will also assume the following Quarto configuration file *\_quarto.yml* in @lst-quarto-config.

::: {#lst-quarto-config}
```yaml
project:
  title: "Web project"
  type: website
  execute-dir: project              # <1>
  render:                           # <2>
    - index.qmd
    - process/1_acquire.qmd
    - process/2_curate.qmd
    - process/3_transform.qmd
    - process/4_analyze.qmd
    - reports/

website:
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"                 # <3>
    contents:                       # <4>
      - index.qmd
      - section: "Process"
        contents: process/*         # <5>
      - section: "Reports"
        contents: reports/*         # <6>

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true

execute:
  freeze: auto                      # <7>
```

2. **Render order**: The order in which files are rendered.
3. **Sidebar style**: The style of the sidebar.
4. **Sidebar contents**: The contents of the sidebar.
5. **Process contents**: The contents of the process section.
6. **Reports contents**: The contents of the reports section.
7. **Freeze option**: The option for rendering only changed files.

Quarto configuration file for reproducible research
:::

Looking more closely at the directory structure in @lst-quarto-website, let's focus on the aspects that are shared between articles and presentations. You will notice that the *reports/* directory contains a *figures/* directory for saving figures, a *tables/* directory for saving tables, and a *references.bib* file for saving references. These are shared resources that can be used in both articles and presentations. In the process directory, you can save tables, figures, and other resources that are generated during the research process that you believe will be useful in commmunicating the research findings. Then, when you create your presentations, you can include the same materials in either format with the same files. If changes are made to the figures or tables, they will be updated in both the article and the presentation(s).

Next, it is worth pointing out some important features that appear in the @lst-quarto-config configuration file. The `execute-dir` specifies the root directory for all execution. That is the path to directories and files will be the same no matter from what file the code is executed. The `render` option specifies the order in which the files are rendered. This is important for ensuring that the research process is executed in the correct order. The files that are executed and rendered for display appear in the website and the `style` and `contents` options specify the style and contents of the sidebar, respectively. Another key option is the `freeze` option under `execute`. This option specifies that only changed files will be rendered. This helps avoid re-rendering files that have not changed, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.

#### Articles

In the *reports/* directory a file named *article.qmd* appears. This file, which can be named anything, will be the document in which we will draft the research article. This file is a standard Quarto document. However, we can take advantage of some options that we have not seen so far that adds functionality to the document.

In @lst-quarto-article, we see an example of the YAML frontmatter for a Quarto article.

::: {#lst-quarto-article}
```yaml
title: "Article"
date: 2024-02-20
author:                               # <1>
  - name: "Your name"
    email: youremail@school.edu
    affiliation: "Your affiliation"
abstract: |                           # <2>
  This is a sample article. It is a work in progress and will be updated as the research progresses.
keywords:                             # <3>
  - article
  - example
csl: citation-style.csl               # <4>
bibliography: ../bibliography.bib     # <5>
citation: true                        # <6>
format:                               # <7>
  html: default                       # <8>
  pdf:                                # <9>
    number-sections: true
```
1. **Author information**: The author information for the article.
2. **Abstract**: The abstract for the article.
3. **Keywords**: The keywords for the article.
4. **Citation style**: The citation style for the article.
5. **Bibliography**: The bibliography for the article.
6. **Citation**: The citation for the article itself.
7. **Format**: The format for the article.
8. **HTML format**: The HTML format for the article (for web presentation)
9. **PDF format**: The PDF format for the article (for printing)

Quarto article YAML frontmatter
:::

In addition to typical YAML frontmatter, we see a number of new times. Looking at the first three, we see that we can add author information, an abstract, and keywords. These are standard for articles and are used to provide information about the article to readers.

When rendered, the article header information will now contain this new information, as seen in @fig-header-format.

::: {#fig-header-format}

[![](images/header-format.png)]{alt-text="Header format for Quarto article"}

Appearance of the header format for a Quarto article.
:::

The next two items are the citation style and bibliography. These are used to create and format citations in the article. The citation style is a CSL file that specifies the citation style. You can find a database of various citation styles at the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You can search for a style or by field. Once you find a style you like, you can download the CSL file and add it to your project. The bibliography is a BibTeX file that contains the references for the article. You can create this file (as mentioned before) in a reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley.

Now the `citation` option is not for references that we have gathered. Rather, it is for generating a citation for the current article. This is useful if someone else would like to cite your article. When the article is rendered, the citation will appear at the bottom of the article, as seen in @fig-citation-attribution.

::: {#fig-citation-attribution}

[![](images/citation-attribution.png)]{alt-text="Citation attribution in Quarto article"}

:::

There are two other features to mention. One is the `format` option. Since the article is a Quarto document, it can be rendered in multiple formats. The `html` option ensures that our article is rendered in HTML format as part of the website. However, in addition, we can add a `pdf` option that will render the article in PDF format. Note that in @fig-header-format, the `pdf` option has created an "Other formats" listing on the right side below the table of contents. Clicking this will open the PDF version of the article.

Although not employed in this example, it is also possible to use more extensive format changes with [Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html). Currently, there are various extensions for different journals and publishing houses. For more information and examples, consult the documentation above.

#### Presentations

In the *reports/* directory we can also include presentations and associated slide decks. A popular web-based presentation framework is [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). This framework is used in Quarto to create presentations. In @lst-quarto-website, the *slides/* directory contains a directory for each presentation and an *index.qmd* file within. The *index.qmd* file contains the presentation content, which we will see soon. To provide a listings page each presentation, the *presentations.qmd* file contains special YAML instructions to be a listings page.

Let's first dive into the *index.qmd* file for a presentation and discuss some of the key features. In @lst-quarto-presentation, we see a basic example of a Quarto presentation.

::: {#lst-quarto-presentation}

```yaml
title: "Examle presentation"
date: 2024-02-20
author: "Jerid Francom"
format: revealjs
```

Quarto presentation YAML frontmatter *index.qmd*
:::

The YAML frontmatter for a Quarto presentation is similar to that of most Quarto documents. The title, date, and author are all included. The `format` option specifies that the presentation will be rendered in `reveal.js` format. When rendered, the presentation the slide deck will be interactive and can be navigated by the user. The slide deck will also be responsive and can be viewed on any device.

In @fig-revealjs-example, we see an example of a Quarto presentation rendered in `reveal.js` format. I will discuss some of the key features of the presentation, in the presentation itself.

::: {#fig-revealjs-example}
```{=html}
<style>
.slide-deck {
  width: 90%;
  height: 400px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
</style>
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="presentation/"></iframe>
```

### Peer facing communication

For those who are interested in interacting with your work, it is key to prepare materials that can be reliably shared. This includes the research code and data. In the next section, we will discuss some of the strategies for sharing research code and data, including version control with Git, pinned R package versions with {renv}, and containerization with Docker.

#### Version control

Version control is a key part of reproducible research. It allows you to track changes to your research code and data over time. This is important for ensuring that your research is reproducible and transparent. One of the most popular version control systems is Git. Git allows you to track changes to your research code and data, collaborate with others, and share your research with the world. GitHub is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows you to share your research code and data with others, collaborate on research projects, and contribute to open source projects.

You are now familiar with working with Git and GitHub, but there are a few additional aspects to cover to ...


#### Pinned package versions

As you develop your research code, you will likely use a number of R packages. These packages are constantly being updated, which can lead to issues with reproducibility. To ensure that your research is reproducible, it is important to pin the versions of the R packages that you use. This can be done with the {renv} package. {renv} allows you to create a snapshot of the R packages that you use in your research project. This snapshot can then be shared with others, ensuring that they have the same versions of the R packages that you used.


#### Containerization

Containerization is another key part of reproducible research. It allows you to create a self-contained environment for your research code and data. This environment can then be shared with others, ensuring that they have everything they need to reproduce your research. One popular containerization tool is Docker. Docker allows you to create a container that contains all of the dependencies for your research project. This container can then be shared with others, ensuring that they have everything they need to reproduce your research.

When creating a reproducible computing environment, it will be necessary to include system dependencies to ensure that the project is reproducible. The `pak` package provides a way to determine the dependencies for a package or set of packages on a given operating system (platform).

```r
pak::pkg_sysreqs(pkg = "knitr", sysreqs = "ubuntu")
```

```xml
── Install scripts ── Ubuntu NA
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install pandoc

── Packages/ system dependencies
knitr – pandoc
```

These can be added to the computational setup script for the project.
