When creating a reproducible computing environment, it will be necessary to include system dependencies to ensure that the project is reproducible. The `pak` package provides a way to determine the dependencies for a package or set of packages on a given operating system (platform).

```r
pak::pkg_sysreqs(pkg = "knitr", sysreqs = "ubuntu")
```

```xml
── Install scripts ── Ubuntu NA
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install pandoc

── Packages/ system dependencies
knitr – pandoc
```

These can be added to the computational setup script for the project.
